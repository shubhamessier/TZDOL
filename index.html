                <p>Woah, what a month this has been I'll try my personal best to encapsulate it. I still remember the first day of this month, when I took a break from the office to meet someone – it was kind of daring of me to do so I had to make some professional lie to make everyone believe it. It turned out to be a good memory of mine, I enjoyed that evening, eating the spaghetti I didn't like very much.</p>
                <p>All my life, I've been riding sinking boats, and I didn't want to ride any more. Even when things went south, I still wanted to keep up with it, trying to save something that wasn't going to stay despite my best efforts. But how would I know? I didn't even have the chance to give my best efforts. I don't know why, but nobody really wants to enjoy life for what it is, for what and how beautiful it can be. It makes sense when you realize that there exist ways to dilute your pain, to dilute your experience. However, the dilution of pain comes at a bigger cost of life, and in the end, it's a tradeoff.</p>
                <p>I also had to leave the sinking boats, as the wise ones say, you have to leave from somewhere to get somewhere. The phrase "leaving isn't easy, so is moving on" resonates with me. For some, it might be, but for me, it is painful. It leaves me with a migraine and chaos all together. I begin to love chaos in my life, or I can say that disorder is my order. My head felt like an exploding time bomb, ready to go off any second… but I managed through it. I managed through the pain, and in the end, it left me wanting to love myself, or support myself in the moments I never did. For all the stupid rules I set for myself, the lack of understanding about my own self is the thing that gets me into troubles and uninvited pain. I accept it I open my arms for all the pain that comes. I will go through it I'll rather be in pain than having my life fucked every day for some sad reason.</p>
                <p>But at this point in my life, I want more challenges, more sleepless nights. I want to come out of it strong and better than ever, not the same Shubham again. I didn't want the constant hurting to continue. I refuse to be someone else's second option for my life.</p>
                <p>If you didn't understand any of this, maybe you shouldn't try to. There's a lot more to my life than this, than any of this. After all this happened, I had an intense week of working on the prototype I've been building. I focused every second of my life on it, pulling late-nighters all weekend. I remember one fine evening of constant hacking and programming I chugged three cups of dark coffee. I was like a workhorse, running every single brain cell to achieve the things at hand. I programmed the entire download page at night and also the entire backend for the prototype alone. I finally did it, thousands of compilation errors and issues later. I finally built something worth showing to people. I wasn't completely alone in all this my colleagues helped me through this process. And in doing so, I stayed in the present. I could feel every click of the mouse, every keystroke on the keyboard — nothing else in life, no pain, no regrets. It was a zen thing for me. That was a really memorable week for my life. I did all this with a ticking time bomb strapped to my head. I worked past deadlines, past regularity, and past comfort. I was in a continuum, unbothered and fast.</p>

                   <p>I couldn't really say much, but the events of life become recurring sometimes, different roads, but same crossroads. I had an office party, a celebration, which became a fun yet memorable experience of my life. I've been living in Jaipur for quite some time now. I've gone to Badi Chaupar thrice, and it holds a lot of bittersweet memories for me. I haven't had time to visit other places much. Anyway, we planned for an evening above the ground, at Jaipur's famous fort, to really end the day with a royal touch. While my colleagues were busy taking pictures, I sat down quietly on a wall fence, tripping over city lights as they shone like distant stars in the twilight of the never-tiring city life. It was a moment of reflection for all the things I've been doing since I came here, and of how I haven't changed at all.</p>
                   <p>I saw someone taking pictures of the city beside me. I saw her taking those shots, and I was in her way, so I gave her some space. Then I controlled myself, but I told her, "You can lower the exposure, the pictures will be even better." She said, I am also learning these days to click these shots", I did some tweaks on her phone, and she liked it. I couldn't resist myself, so I asked her to take pictures of herself. I clicked a few, and she liked them apparently. With just fine adjustments, those portraits looked beautiful. I couldn't believe myself, so I asked a little about her. She told me about the places she has been to and her experience of the city.</p>
                   <p>It was time to go, my colleagues ordered something, so I had to go. But before going, I mumbled that, "I might not like to have your contact, there's a beauty to missing someone." I asked her name before going. It was moments after going that I realized what I couldn't explain to her. I asked my colleague what to do now, and she told me to "run back". And yeah, that's what I did next, I ran back to the same place and said, "Hey, Sandhya, I've figured out the equation of what I wanted to say. I told her about my bad experiences of meeting a person and having to stay in touch with messages back and forth, keeping the relation alive. There's a beauty to leaving things at open ends after all, we all want someone to miss. She really understood and said, "You came back now take some more pictures." I happily did.</p>
                   <p>Then I had to leave I shook hands and left, and that was the evening I was yearning for a long time, something to make me feel alive and back human. I couldn't calculate if I am ever going to meet her I don't really feel sad. I feel some good in me and more contentment of what this day has been. Even if I don't get to meet Sandhya again, but one thing I know for sure  how boring my life feels. I know contentment is found in the fort on the hill. And the evening after that? That's a story for another time.</p>

                    <div class="post-quote">Floating Point</div>
                    <p>I've come to ideate a lot more, use my imagination for creating beautiful things and designs. It's a beautiful process. I like the working and mechanism of startups in general, they are indeed a really reactive place. Fun to work at least, sometimes.</p>
                    <p>Sometimes the instance of sharing my life with someone is frightening and beautiful simultaneously, but I don't really agree on the idea of giving myself all out having nothing but dreams of someone. Maybe I am too young to think that. Sometimes these are the reasons why happiness eludes me. I hate that I grow really specific and this doesn't work out well with everyone. The really perfect imagery of "the one" in my mind makes me sad of what's not possible anymore in this world, maybe I've grown in the wrong direction, watered by the fantasies and the utmost perfect dreams.</p>
                    <p>I like dancing, but I don't really like going to clubs, that's not really my type I quickly understood. If burning a pile of cash at midnight (I've got better ideas for doing that) is all to be cool I am an outtie here. I am not against it, well I do want to hang out in clubs sometimes pretending to be Patrick Bateman from American Psycho myself, I can't really do it now, I am not that guy. I actually made a list of the movie scenes I wanna recreate, obviously the bookshop scene from Notting Hill is one of them, also the Social Network dorm room hacking scene and a lot of nerdy fan moments.</p>
                    <p>Oh and also I've outgrown my instant coffee kicks, thanks to my office friends. I don't really use coffee as my fuel 5 times a day. My days have been filled with challenges and learning curves, but thanks to my parents for making me strong enough to go through every problem in my life. Also some secret friends from office I can't really take names of for helping me out and making my little world a better place.</p>

                    <p>I as a human have realised that how hard I avoid this fact, I’m aware of what my vulnerabilities are. They change me as a person. The things I hate about myself are the ones who make me want to walk that extra mile in life, the ones who don’t let me sleep.</p>

                    <div class="post-quote">Coffee-Overflow</div>
                    <p>Apologies for the late update. Here’s something I wrote today on Notepad during lunchtime in the office.</p>
                    <p>Being one with nature is a different concept that actually makes me feel more alive. But there’s another kind of “oneness” that makes life hell. See this example from my life: I told myself some days ago, “My API doesn’t work, my life is Hell!”</p>
                    <p>My life might be hell, but it’s not because of this API problem. It’s just a mask for my deeper internal issues. I realized that these daily problems are just a wrapper for my own personal internal struggles. Solving these won’t have much of an effect on how I perceive the personal hell of my life. Sometimes I have to just move on, keeping my head down. There’s no other path to redemption other than facing the pain I’ve been through, not just any pain, but the one that makes me feel alive, the one that gives my life meaning, the one that lets me sleep in silence, the one that I don’t regret having.</p>
                    <p>I might be wrong on thousands of endpoints in life, but I might be right here. True oneness will come from facing my fears, the pain without any escape, having that “bare” conversation with life, wiping off that slate clean, once and for all. This is the only true liberation. My decisions and choices are heavily influenced by the way I feel about myself. If self-hate grows at this rate, I might not achieve anything worthwhile in life. It’s simple math if I can’t love myself, no one else will. Self-love is not just a hoax; it’s a real thing now.</p>

                    <p>Sundays never felt like this one before. While I wanted to fix my life since the beginning of this year, I overlooked the emotional aspect of it, which now I’m beginning to see lucidly. There’s a certain beauty to people and things which also get overlooked in a similar manner. I believe now flowers aren’t just pretty, they are living embodiment of life and they are more than just an earthly thing. Something things of beauty hold a very special relation to me, and they just stay close to my heart. While you might not be able to decipher everything I’m saying, I believe someone just found my decryption key.</p>

                    <p>“It finally feels like a save game moment…”</p>
                    <p>Back during summer in my fifth or sixth grade year, I was hooked on playing games on my computer. One thing I noticed was that most games, like GTA and Total Overdose, they had this floppy disk hovering at certain points, indicating the save game location. This was where I could save all my hard-earned progress from completing missions. But wait.. why am I telling you this? Yesterday was one of those save game moments for me, and the location was Jaipur, Rajasthan. It started a few weeks ago with an online interview at a startup that went well. This week, I went there for an in-person interview, which was different because most of my previous interviews, except for the Air Force one, were conducted online. I was a little nervous about how it would turn out.</p>
                  <p>The night before the interview, I couldn’t sleep much, not out of fear, but because my mind wouldn’t stop even though my body desperately wanted to rest. It kept running through different scenarios, most of them untrue. Short on sleep, I had to wake up early to catch the train. It was a pleasant ride with beautiful salt fields, especially the red ones. To keep my spirits high, I played some Coldplay music. After arriving, I took the metro and walked 4 km to the interview location. I was sweating profusely but I made it. I grabbed a random book, opened a page, and started reading until I was called in. The interview lasted about 45 minutes. I remember looking at the whiteboard and thought of using it, so I presented a system I had designed recently. I know I could have presented a better design if I had gotten better REM sleep. The interview shifted towards philosophical questions, which provided me with a better platform to express myself and my thoughts. I felt more articulate. After the interview, I waited outside while reading a book about death that was on the table. I dove headfirst into some thoughts until I was called back into the room an hour later. They informed me that I had gotten the job! in an official way.</p>
                 <p>I had to call Ritik and tell him the news. Then, I went to a local cafe and ordered some maggi to eat, as I hadn’t had much breakfast. I called Ritik, telling him every detail. Finally, I caught a breath. The weather was pleasant, overcast and cool or should I say it was “my kinda weather”. I sat there quietly for a while, simply feeling the cool breeze on my face, finally relaxing. I was happy. Next, I met Nandini as we had planned after the interview. I took the metro to meet her area and then spent hours talking, walking around the area, visiting parks and cafes, and finally going for some Udupi food & Filter coffee, I remember the bell they had put up on every table to call someone for the order or the bill it caught my attention and it was a polite way of summoning someone for a work, I found it a great place to go around. then finally saying goodbye to her. Now the next thing was to come back home, I was slightly tired, but I didn’t want to stop exploring, so I continued to discover other areas before catching a late train. I waited for hours at the station, taking trips to different platforms, my legs aching from all the walking. Finally, I dozed off on the train.</p>
                 <p>Yes, this was the day, “the save game moment”, that I will share with others. But you, my friend, already know about it before I even tell you. you know all my secrets and the tricks I keep up my sleeves. Sometimes I see there’s something more to my life’s struggles and problems which I can’t completely decipher today, but we’ll see it together, right?</p>

                  <div class="post-quote">"Alive"</div>
                  <p>There are some things on my mind that I've been holding in these days, and I must write them now. Well, firstly, I've slowed down in my search for good projects. Is it a lack of motivation? I don't know clearly, but possibly yes, or it might be due to a lack of positive responses that I think I should've gotten by now. But whatever it may be, I must keep going until I land something I want, which is to say, a good role in a company I want to work with.</p>
                  <p>My cold emails these days are sparse in numbers, but I want to ramp them up again this time, rise like I always do, even better than last time. All these days and experiences have made me understand the importance of getting challenged in life. I would love to get my butt kicked by time, the sooner the better, before I stagnate or end up on the wrong path. At this point in my life, I don't want to get comfortable at home or at work. I want to come home every day eager to learn new things. I don't seek stability; I crave growth. All the quotes I've heard tell me it's uncomfortable, and I do want that in my life.</p>
                  <p>I don't want to come home every day with nothing meaningful to do or succumb to the slow, tempting comfort of a bedroom. I want meaning in my life, and I'm going to strive for that for myself, not to fulfill someone else's dreams. Obviously, I'm not blinded by ambition to overlook the importance of the people in my life, nor do I want to give up the simplicity of life I have now. The idea of working on something at a desk for hours seems more satisfying than aimlessly sacrificing my sleep and well-being for others who don't truly value me.</p>
                  <p>I really want to hit the gym again. But this time, I want to be full of energy every day, preserving some for the gym. No beating around the bush, I like feeling exhausted, giving it my all every day. That makes me feel more alive, kind of weird, isn't it? I loved that feeling of watching montages from Rocky & Creed and going for the next round. Last time I made some mistakes working out, like not having enough energy or not eating properly. I realize that no matter how many small mistakes I identify and fix in myself, there's always room for improvement. It's the will and the fire that truly take you far.  Also, it feels like "home is where I am." Wherever I go, I carry the good and the bittersweet experiences with me. Sometimes, contentment is all I need, and when I have it, my geographical location doesn't matter much to me.</p>

                  <p>Through some family work I got to go to Delhi for one day. As usual my response was "Hell Yeah!" not looking forward for the work but for a chance to be myself again, wander some unknown streets, meet some new people, get out of the small box I live in (not my home). It took a 10-hour train journey to get there, and some sleep cut short. But it was worth it, as the morning began, I walked down the streets of New Delhi, carefully looking for my phone, as it has been seen people are fond of using other's phones more often there. I would've lost my only camera that day :)</p>
                  <p>I wandered streets following arbitrary turns my mind commanded me to take. I walked for a couple of hours before coming back to where I was staying. It got decided to go to a Select city which was in a close vicinity next. Forward to some time later I was standing in this crowd of thousands of people I never met, all different to me, all separated from me by huge gaps of culture and lifestyle. I saw people, different people. I come from a small, not-so-populous city of Jodhpur, also not as developed as metro cities in some ways, but what I saw the most was a cultural shift there. I shouldn't be going to describe the semantics here.</p>
                  <p>I don't know how I exactly felt that moment or what the correct word for that is, but I didn't seem to blend into that crowd. I felt everything at once in that moment: This pressure of life I am not able to handle, this box living I'm not made for. I heard the world calling me, the life I always wanted, the work I always wanted, the happiness I always wanted, and yet I saw myself bound by the chains of luck, failure, and misery which I couldn't seem to break. After that moment, I felt a sudden relief through my body. That moment was a realization. It was more than just a mere part of time; it came to me and I soaked it in myself.</p>
                  <p>Then I continued seeing some other places visiting here and there and then finally taking a metro back to the station. What I think is that people there travel a lot in metro, this being their easiest commute possible. They spend a significant amount of time traveling in it only to realize that a good amount of time has passed by. "Thus life moves fast in a tube."</p>
                  <p>I was happy that I got to experience this in my life. Delhi became more than a city for me. I really enjoyed the rest of my time there. In fact, I would plan to go there again soon. I loved the city.</p>
                  <p>I didn't take any rest, but I had to go to Pokhran the same day I returned from Delhi. Well, it was a marriage after all. Unlike the traditional city marriages, I found it actually intelligent who marry in smaller cities/towns. It's a small and tightly knit bond what they have, not much of a show for people to watch but definitely worth going to. The main highlight which I enjoyed was the clear weather or I say pollution-free skies, that striked like a thunderbolt inside my mind to capture what? Stars. Yeah, I wouldn't lie, but this was one of the most beautiful night skies I've captured yet. It's just beautiful. I still couldn't believe capturing cosmic giants other than the stars and moon; this time I got to capture even Nebulas! It initially skipped my eyes too, until someone made me notice. I just couldn't take my eyes off the sight. Aaah, it's a great feeling. If you wanna see, make sure your brightness is higher and zoom in on the colorful pixels which you can see. Here are the shots. This was unreal.</p>

                  <p>"Oh I am young again, this was all a day dream, as cold tears streamed down my face I said, thanks for waking me up" I wished this was true. but it isn't true right? There will be no day dream that ends and wakes me as a different person a person far away from pain and despair, woken into an alternate reality where I am the protagonist of my own life. The more I think about this whole day dreaming thing, the more I wished It was true, but I had to move on, I had to really "wake up". I have this ache in my soul to touch that blurry infinite thing.. that infinite echo of terminal I could never see the end of...</p>
                  <p>Well this was just the internal chatter talk going inside my mind when I'm alone. but there isn't any stopping to what I create with the free compute resources of my own cloud head, this whole idea of pre-colonisation era of humanity excites me everything from the daily lifestyle, the society, the peasants, the kings how would've they lived? Sadly there isn't a way to get back in time and experience that all.. but if we all do live in a computer simulation there must be some existing cheatcodes to these lives which are human players haven't found yet.. Oh how classic foolishery that would be.. well someone must say we are not as evolved as we think we are...</p>
                  <p>But wait if there's a matrix or simulation then there must be some lag in between the events of this life, how miniscule that might be, it must be there.. is that the difference it takes between a person considered as 1 or 0? if so isn't life so short as comparable to a network lag between two states, all the emotions, memories we hold just disappear into thin air. it is frightening and calming at the same time, why you ask? I'd say it is what it is.</p>

                  <p>I have my GATE exam tomorrow, and to be honest, I haven't prepared well. I did cover a few subjects from the course last year, but that came to a halt when my results were announced. I have to start a sound preparation for next year's exam from this month only to get a good score. I believe in myself that I'll do well, once and for all. I have to consider other career options after college. I should be researching that now, and I'll do it soon. Go abroad? That does seem exhilarating to me. "Leave everything at midnight and go to some country that I love and that doesn't know me, that was always the plan" (just joking, no real plans like this). If I have to do this, I won't leave anything in between before moving to the next part of life.</p>
                  <p>I don't have the classic dilemma for the subject choices I want to go for; that has always been a constant variable. "Constant-variable" isn't that a bit fishy sounding? Also, I am working on getting an internship again. Well, this is the same process as last year, but this time my character seems to have gotten some charismatic upgrades. This time it will be a little tougher process than last year as I seem to have some constraints (financial+academic), but I ain't giving up on anything. I am headed in a good direction for now. I'm trying to be a better man.</p>
                  <p>For what I'm hearing these days This one has gotten me to love music once again in a bustling life, being the center point of my thoughts and my good mood. It just steals a piece straight out of my heart. There's a good chance you'll find me humming this these days, I also want to go for ice skating too, straight up inspired by Rocky, but yeah, it does seem a geographical satire considering my current location. Don't know, it seems to me different than adventure sports, but why? The answer to which my buggered heart doesn't know.</p>
                  <p>*A sneak peek into my mind* "What is it really that lets me sleep well? Or more precisely, what is it about life that calms me?" Believe it or not, but questioning life has become a new hobby of mine. Not that I question everyone on the street, but now I do challenge my faith that I've held for a long time, like the simple trust bonds I have with different people, also the default settings my relationship with other people is. Is it good or bad to challenge my faith? I don't know the answer, but I do seem to notice that the more I challenge my faith or opinions about something, the stronger it gets. There's an initial friction to this thought, but bypassing it is rewarding. I do seem to notice that not changing anything and just letting things come in my way isn't satisfying as well. The small differences I make to my life make a huge difference to thoughts and the way I see myself.</p>
                  <p>Also I fear of being adapting to the easyness of life which is a red pill blue pill situation again, either I wake up to the reality or I sleep and think it was all just daydreams, the things that other people say so casually sometimes touches me deep within, it scares me to be ordinary to be someone who is a perfect fit by this society, this fear of this constant bondage that this society implies on me & my free running thoughts constantly, I hate to say it but I feel like I'm the Julius Caesar of this dystopian world. maybe I think too much, or did I take the blue pill last night after dinner?</p>

                  <p>I'd prefer the former option. I had my interview for my internship yesterday, and it just didn't go as planned. I can say that the reason is me. I didn't prepare well this time. I learned SQL a few days earlier, but it didn't work out, as I hadn't covered the advanced sections, which were probably the important ones I missed. I blanked out during the interview, and halfway through, I knew the result already. I felt shame in a part where I wanted to leave it, but that was not an option for me. I could see many ways where I went wrong. It was one of the first interviews I had that went this terribly.  </p>
                  <p> I felt low after giving it, and the reason was clear as hell. I just didn't feel like discussing it with anyone after that. I felt collapsing inward. But I am writing this to remember the next time I go for bigger things in my life. It will be a remembrance that it wasn't all rainbows and sunshine I went through. I don't want to forget yesterday for what it was. It wasn't my inability to answer some questions I didn't know, it was me who was unable. In this light-speed life, the rush in my heart to skip things seems a perfect option, but I know it isn't the way I'm meant to go. I'd never be a failure if someone else said so. It'll probably be me who has given up on his dreams and ambitions for something smaller, shallower, which he never wanted. I must go through this for what may seem a tough time to others and partly to me but is actually a path to realisation for me.</p>
                  <p>If life ever gets all sorted out or good, I would remember that it wasn't easy, even though I cried my tears never fell in shallow waters.</p>

                  <p>“Yeah it was Battlefield I, which came to my mind at the end.”</p>
                  <p>This is a story about someone close to me who challenged my thinking about life in many ways and even changed it, she goes by the name Anna Scott (changed it). although she seems to have come from notting hill, she indeed is one from sense and sensibility for me. Although I haven’t met her in real life, I can feel her presence within my mind and thoughts. I met Anna in an online community, which I joined because it seemed interesting. She had a unique perspective on life that set her apart. I was genuinely impressed by her intelligence, which was evident from the very start. For the first few months, I didn’t even know her full name, which was a reflection of my foolishness. It took me a challenging 10-day game to know her full name, and that’s when I realized how patient and fun she could be, two qualities rarely found together. I admired her for that. Before all this I had hit a rough patch in my life, where my trust and belief in love was over and I became a free bird, not waiting for anyone to come and help me.</p>
                  <p>Over time, I gradually got to know her better. I would ask about her day, her college life, her interests, and her life journey so far. She was an intriguing person, and we shared some common interests, especially our determination towards each other. Talking to her gave me a sense of excitement and longing that I hadn’t felt in a long time. It wasn’t my fault she truly was an impressive individual. I was falling for her, one day at a time, and affection was growing in my heart, a feeling I cherished. After all, she was smart, and I never doubted her. I never knew much internet slangs before I started talking to her, but she taught me many, some I use till this day, like “Kyool”.</p>
                  <p>She was not only intelligent but also, I believed, beautiful, although I had never seen her face at that time. We spent months talking to each other every day at the same time, and this routine continued. I even got to know her name and added her on my instagram. When I felt like I was becoming a “lovebug,” I gathered the courage to tell her about my feelings in January. It was an online scribble match one evening when I shared that I had started to develop feelings for her. However, my dreams didn’t unfold as planned. I first scribbled some characters, and we played for a while then and I wrote, “I have developed strong feelings for you and I never saw you..” well she was out of words to say.</p>
                  <p>She pointed out that it would be difficult for us to be together and that there was no possibility of a deeper connection. I understood her perspective. Unlike other girls, she was always kind to me. I think She knew I wasn’t ready for a relationship, and that I had many things to figure out in my life. She was right, and I appreciated her honesty. She was becoming the girl of my morning dreams, someone I would be fortunate to have in my life.</p>
                  <p>At some point, my feelings for her grew intense, and I found myself taking photos of coconut trees whenever I saw them. They reminded me of the coconut plantations in South India, where she was from. Anna seemed a bit concerned that my feelings were getting too strong, while I worried about whether I was causing her discomfort. We decided to stop talking for a while, but I couldn’t get her off my mind. I couldn’t find a replacement for her, as I did with other things in life. I had many friends to keep me company, but none were quite like her. I missed her sense of humor and our daily conversations, even though I had never seen her face. I still have a few photos of her that she shared with me, which was a small consolation.</p>
                  <p>One day, I confided in a friend about my strong desire to see her face and hear her voice. She suggested I should just ask her, so I did. Unfortunately, she politely declined my request. In my free time, I would search the internet to learn more about her city, its culture, and the beaches, but it didn’t quell my longing for her. February 23 was a significant month in our story, and I knew I had to meet her somehow. I applied for many internships in her state that were similar and in line with my profile, for all the institutes I knew, and one morning while walking to the bus for my college, I checked my email and received an acceptance offer from her city. I was thrilled at the prospect of going there, but what happened next would alter the course of my life.</p>
                  <p>I asked about this situation with Anna and told her about my plans of her city and staying with her, while I promised her before that I’d meet her someday, in her city. I had other good internship offers, but I chose her city because I was getting impatient to meet her. After talking with her, though, I realized I might be making a mistake by sacrificing a good career opportunity. So, after some contemplation, I shifted my decision. My new destination became Trichy (Still close to her), a decision that turned out to be one of the best I had made in years. However, I was determined to meet her in her city at least once during my time there, and she agreed to meet me once, so it was a happy time for me. I was happy with travelling thousands of kilometers just to see her once for one evening. I actually wanted to suprise her by showing up at her college without informing her, that was the plan atleast, but I saw some flaws in this one as this would give her more shock than excitement, so this one got discarded.</p>
                  <p>After spending a few days in Trichy, I decided to discuss the possibility of meeting Anna with her. I had my tickets ready and inquired if we could finally arrange a time for us to meet. However, due to personal reasons, she declined and suggested that I come after a festival. I agreed, remaining patient. But as my days in Trichy were drawing to a close and I asked once more, she refused to meet me, this time, for good. I vividly recall that morning, it left me feeling deeply disheartened. Internally, I felt fragemented. I took a day off from work and stayed in my room alone, avoiding the office that day. I was angry with myself. It built up in my head.</p>  
                  <p>I couldn’t quite comprehend why she made that decision. I knew for sure she didn’t intend to hurt me, but somehow, it had happened. This experience made me realize how intricate life can be and even her smallest of decisions profoundly impact my life.</p>  
                  <p>Overall, I believed it was over. We continued texting regularly for a few more days, but then in August, I informed her that I was going to deactivate my Instagram account. Subsequently, I chose to sever the connection between us, leaving our story incomplete. I began to doubt whether I could ever carve a place in her heart, even though I had hoped to do so. She had become a significant part of my dreams and letting go proved to be a challenging task. For months of her absence, it felt like a void feeling, something that’ll come when you lose someone close to you, There was no doubt she was close to my heart. I thought of sharing this feeling of missing Anna with my friends, but these constant thoughts of Anna would make them think that I’d gone insane, so I kept these to myself. Fast forward to today, this has become one of the events in my past life, something I can never respawn myself to relive again. If there’s any regret in me it’s getting more of that feeling of my heart pounding, that adrenaline racing in my veins, and that feeling of reaching an oasis in my mind after a long string of never-ending sunny days.</p>  
                  <p>After all this I tried being with other people for a while, but it never worked out, because of what, you ask? it was me probably, I couldn’t be that person I was with anna, never that same shubham again, that feeling never kicked back in my blood again, that feeling aah! just the memories of spending imagining about that evening that never happened, were more pleasent sometimes than being with another stranger (I understand it’s not fair to live this way). I stopped trying, to pretend someone I can be, I just didn’t try, left it completely. while my words might sound more poetic than practical. but lemme tell you I thought the same when I read something like this, being on the other side now, I feel it deeply, far beyond the small limits of practicality. While I am writing and recalling all this, many bitter-sweet feelings race through my mind, but there’s some future to this which I can’t predict now, but it is for time to tell. I owe anna this story, for all her kindness and friendship that meant so much to me when I needed her the most, I cannot forget that. As I write this she must be 22, Though I remember her birthday this January, this whole aftermath just goes in my mind and I couldn’t wish her.
                    I am a changed man now, I don’t ever rest now, there’s no home for my thoughts and my body, I love this this life of a wanderer, without having a “point B” in my life, to sit at every bench in life I want and start walking again, with no desire to reach any end, just to see life as endlessly as I can, to never stop for anyone or anything that I don’t want. a ordinary life doesn’t intersts me anymore, after all this I fear of being ordinary in this world, I fear of falling for someone like anna and I don’t want to settle now, never.</p>  
                  <p>And that’s my story “A lost boy who loved a stranger more than ever, in doing so he found himself a new feeling he never knew he had”. Things get mixed up with time and you’ll probably hear other versions, “A mad boy who went way far away, then made a fool of himself”. But what you heard from me is the truth, I wouldn’t tell you if it wasn’t, would I?</p>

                  <p>The thing about the moon and city lights is that they create a particularly large glare in my night shots (a good 1/3 portion of it). I am intrigued about how I can counter this phenomenon — there must be some way, at least that professionals use, and something specific for my use case. Well, all I can say for now is that it adds a good effect to this particular shot (apparently). You can see all of them here. I’ve tried listening to music while I click these photos at night, and it lifts up the complete experience of capturing stars at night. Oh and if you didn’t zoom in on the images i shared, you missed some important details, besides the regularly shining pole stars there are some dwarf ones you can only see when you zoom in on them.</p>
                  <p>So, an interview is coming up again next week, this time for a data analytics role, and I am not nervous about it this time. I’ll prepare as a soldier, sneaky and sharp for all the traps coming my way. Now, from today onwards I’ll be preparing for the technical interview with a changed approach. Usually, I start from scratch for every problem or interview chance I have, but this time I’ll build on top of the things I already know. One thing I always missed is the question I am given at the end of the call to ask. But this time (I knew it), and I asked about the team in detail I’ll be working with and what we’ll be building eventually, this has given me some pointers for what to focus specifically and foremost to other things. So, got a headstart now. I have contributed to some open source projects before, but working on high-level markup or JS has never interested me. What I eventually want to do is contribute to operating systems like Ubuntu. I understand that it takes experience to contribute to such low-level programs, but seeing my name in the contributors list of open-source operating systems such as Ubuntu or Kali is a dream of mine.</p>
                  <p>One particular thought I have, which should not be led by open source — but it’s my blog, and I’ll do it is that I see pain and sadness as two different things now. Of course, they are two different words, but somehow their coexistence exists in our lives. Pain actually breeds solutions, I’d say. In my life, countering it requires doing something every time. Putting effort into something I love relieves my pain, and doing that sometimes requires a spark within. In short, pain is useful as it pushes me to do something I haven’t done, to push my boundaries, or to simply blow my thinking cap once again! I’ve had my fair share of pain in different forms, sometimes physical, sometimes inner. It’s not the best thing I’d want in my life; it hurts me, causes sleepless nights, takes away the comfort of those daily moments and things I enjoy. It breaks me, makes me think about life harder again, that it’s not over yet and I’m not done. I respect pain now for what it is and for what it pushes me to do. I am not at peace with pain, and I’ll never be it hurts me, and it makes me feel alive again, in the end, “pain has the right to be felt.”</p>
