         <div class="post-quote">Alive Again</div>
         <p>Am I alive enough? Or am I just plain surviving? There will always be questions in my head, more than the
            answers I can find. There has been a lot of things I didn't wanted to happen in my life in the previous
            years which cannot be reversed now, but what I have is today to change. even knowing this I sometimes stay
            in my shell not seeking anything out of my life, I seek comfort at times, which is not really someone of my
            age should be doing, I am in a age myself to take risks, move out,. do something worthwhile, to modify what
            I
            call life. The answer being I don't really enjoy things, it's because I've been literally taught to be
            someone not asking questions, just keep my head down and walk in the same lines as others, even this was my
            whole school learning, when the time came to create a line of my own I crashed and burnt, bluntly. It was
            always the good thing to do, but NOT ANYMORE.</p>
         <p>Usually I just spend my sundays either at my flat doing nothing, oversleeping. But today thanks to a great
            recommendation from a friend, I joined a reading group here. I confimed the timings yesterday, I showed up
            early, I waited a while before everyone came in. When I met people today, it was beautiful :) I really liked
            how the community grows together rather than a hamster race in the world. I bought one of my favourite
            authors, Yuval noah harari, it was like picking up my beyblade before going to arena, but it more of became
            a fine choice of my mind to dive into something deeper. I actually chose the book a night before to read
            today, I even packed my bag so that I don't choose to skip it today.</p>
         <p>I met a lot of good people today, I enjoyed the day a lot actually, everything from reading in silence to
            having
            conversations, I felt alive. I met a lot of inspiring people, younger or older than me. I was feeling great
            at that moment, Then after the reading sessions was
            over, I striked conversations with few strangers, I liked getting to know them, to learn about their
            experience or most importantly to hear their stories. I met Karan, Isha and many others with whom I
            instantly felt a connect
            with, then everybody went together for a small brunch, we went to a local cafe nearby to have some fun time
            together getting to know more about each other. All in all, it was a great day, a day I'm down to having
            again. The day went well, while returning I faced enomourous heat waves, I was nearly cooked by the warm
            winds, anyways I managed to reach my flat again. Also at the time of writing this, I am also developing the
            website sideways, for now it looks fine on desktop but a little unusual on mobiles phone, where most of my
            readers are. I've also implied "the less is more" philosophy in my life, Usually I want to get everything at
            once, which is a casue of my anxiety or you can say deep rooted insecurity. I think there's only one thing
            needed at a time, not everything at once, By real example, I can't need to be a high earning guy, with a
            great physique today only. But what I can actually do is start working out today, go to gym consistenly,
            also work on my job sideways to reach where I want, kinda breaking down my goal into actionable steps, as
            said, "One step at a time, one punch at a time, One round at a time"

         <div class="post-quote">The Atomic Conf</div>
         <p>Aah, where do I begin? Usually, my Sundays are preoccupied with continuous tasks like spearfishing, some
            drifting, and a very busy nightlife. I hope you get the pun intended. But anyways, I got to meet someone
            today let's name the person "Lily," someone I knew, but I like the beauty of putting randomness into all my
            processes. I so wanted the conversation to be fresh out of the box. I wanted it to be new again, and Lily
            was
            kind enough to agree to this. Boy, it worked magically.</p>
         <p>Well, Lily knows all the things that happened, but still, I have to write them here. I reached a little
            early
            to the rendezvous point. I had to use my brain to do something out of the box, so I left the place, drove
            back
            some kilometers, and picked a flower, just one. I also wanted to present it myself, but I thought of
            something
            better. I instructed the waiter to present it when we order something, and he did just that. I think that
            might have come as a little surprise, didn't it? So yeah, that was the beginning. I was really amazed to see
            Lily actually being comfortable with the "fresh out-of-the-box thing." I actually really enjoyed that part
            of
            reintroducing something known to me. Well, what can I say? It just felt like playing Far-Cry 3 for the third
            time; it always feels like the first one. It later continued, and it just went on for hours, just as some
            good
            guy read to me, "She was the thunder, I was the drizzle."</p>
         <p>Then we left the place to go eat something else, some street food perhaps, which was, in fact, uncalled for
            but became a great addition to the experiment. As we happened to run out of time, we had to maybe rush up
            the
            experiment. Also, it was a theoretical one, so we didn't reach any conclusion, but that was fine. Sometimes
            the experiment is enjoyable. We called it a day. It wasn't meant to be this way, but anyways, it was great.
         </p>
         <p>As much as interested you might be, I likewise would've declared all the variables and the constants, but I
            can't really push everything too really. So maybe one day you'll know why this was an atomic conf, and why
            did
            I choose the name Lily? Maybe she was a good flower perhaps?</p>

         <div class="post-quote">Shedding the Cobra Skin</div>
         <p>One particular first-time experience I had from the gym was the hardening of skin on my inner hand, and the
            older skin shedding off, due to lifting weights. Similar to a cobra, I also shed some skin at that time,
            which
            was a sign of change. Though I don't continue gym anymore, I do shed some skin every day, even
            metaphorically.
            I do feel the process of change through everyday things.</p>
         <p>I hate people who say, "I don't know," simply ignoring the existence of something, fooling themselves. I've
            been misunderstood my whole life; even when I was good to people, it was seen as a weakness of mine. What
            can
            I really expect from other people when my own girlfriend could never understand the person I am? For her, I
            might've been just another guy on the planet, no different from other people. It's the hurting that follows
            after every good moment. I am not the one to dwell in past and I will never do that, even through hurting
            I'll forget about this someday, but she won't. my life is more precious than that, even down or hurted I
            still have to go through this pain, do a lot of things, get all those materialistic things in my life, be
            that fucking motherfucker who completes his dreams, she won't imagine in her wildest dreams. I can't dwell
            on anything, there's no remorse in my life for people who are gone, I have good people around me to take
            care of, but do you? do you have someone who'll see you everyday for what you are, not for what you look? I
            am not surpised by the answer. </p>
         <p>I was ignorant too. I didn't consider power to be a big deal; I considered intelligence to be my daily
            driver, which was obviously a bad choice for a geek. The feeling of people walking over you every day is
            soul-crushing. It's not the intelligence that makes one happy; it's much deeper than that. Sadly, I became a
            person people could easily pick on. I choose not to be ignorant from now on. I've taken enough hits on my
            head
            to understand this in my life. I choose not to be weak. I am a loner; I accept that. I don't really
            understand
            that there's a small line between dreaming and the other people I see completing them. A leap of faith
            possibly is all it takes.</p>
         <p>I had my feelings crushed too, many times in fact. The time when my crush said no but tried to soften the
            blow, I realized in fact the softening was never meant for me; it was their coping mechanism, their
            mechanism
            to feel good after doing something heinous. It really makes me think whenever I hear someone saying sorry; I
            know that it's not really for me; it's their feel-good verse. But the bottom line is, even having my
            feelings
            crushed, I always stayed at the bottom thinking there would be something good for me. In fact, I was relying
            on luck for a new life, for someone to do; in fact, it never works out this way. Dependence is cancer; it
            kills you from inside. This was the rock bottom of my life; I had nothing to fall back on really. All I had
            was some good friends and a family. I never had good confidence before; my mind is usually rewarded when I
            do
            something meaningful, and for a long time in my life, I hadn't done something worthwhile, so naturally, I
            wasn't confident enough, heavily relying on other people for constant validation.</p>
         <p>For a long time, I never earned a hefty amount, always some small part-time jobs, so naturally I had to rely
            on my parents for support, for which they were kind enough. But again, I couldn't gain confidence from that;
            I
            couldn't really enjoy spending that, other than fulfilling my basic needs. Now, when I am close to earning
            some myself, the first thing I would like to buy is some confidence. I want to walk into a room full of
            people
            as a man, not as a slouched rat.</p>

         <div class="post-quote">"Continuum”</div>
         <p>Woah, what a month this has been I'll try my personal best to encapsulate it. I still remember the first
            day of
            this month, when I took a break from the office to meet someone – it was kind of daring of me to do so I
            had to
            make some professional lie to make everyone believe it. It turned out to be a good memory of mine, I
            enjoyed
            that evening, eating the spaghetti I didn't like very much.
         </p>
         <p>All my life, I've been riding sinking boats, and I didn't want to ride any more. Even when things went
            south, I
            still wanted to keep up with it, trying to save something that wasn't going to stay despite my best
            efforts. But
            how would I know? I didn't even have the chance to give my best efforts. I don't know why, but nobody
            really
            wants to enjoy life for what it is, for what and how beautiful it can be. It makes sense when you
            realize that
            there exist ways to dilute your pain, to dilute your experience. However, the dilution of pain comes at
            a bigger
            cost of life, and in the end, it's a tradeoff.
         </p>
         <p>I also had to leave the sinking boats, as the wise ones say, you have to leave from somewhere to get
            somewhere.
            The phrase "leaving isn't easy, so is moving on" resonates with me. For some, it might be, but for me,
            it is
            painful. It leaves me with a migraine and chaos all together. I begin to love chaos in my life, or I can
            say
            that disorder is my order. My head felt like an exploding time bomb, ready to go off any second… but I
            managed
            through it. I managed through the pain, and in the end, it left me wanting to love myself, or support
            myself in
            the moments I never did. For all the stupid rules I set for myself, the lack of understanding about my
            own self
            is the thing that gets me into troubles and uninvited pain. I accept it I open my arms for all the pain
            that
            comes. I will go through it I'll rather be in pain than having my life fucked every day for some sad
            reason.
         </p>
         <p>But at this point in my life, I want more challenges, more sleepless nights. I want to come out of it
            strong
            and better than ever, not the same Shubham again. I didn't want the constant hurting to continue. I
            refuse to be
            someone else's second option for my life.
         </p>
         <p>If you didn't understand any of this, maybe you shouldn't try to. There's a lot more to my life than
            this, than
            any of this. After all this happened, I had an intense week of working on the prototype I've been
            building. I
            focused every second of my life on it, pulling late-nighters all weekend. I remember one fine evening of
            constant hacking and programming I chugged three cups of dark coffee. I was like a workhorse, running
            every
            single brain cell to achieve the things at hand. I programmed the entire download page at night and also
            the
            entire backend for the prototype alone. I finally did it, thousands of compilation errors and issues
            later. I
            finally built something worth showing to people. I wasn't completely alone in all this my colleagues
            helped me
            through this process. And in doing so, I stayed in the present. I could feel every click of the mouse,
            every
            keystroke on the keyboard — nothing else in life, no pain, no regrets. It was a zen thing for me. That
            was a
            really memorable week for my life. I did all this with a ticking time bomb strapped to my head. I worked
            past
            deadlines, past regularity, and past comfort. I was in a continuum, unbothered and fast.

         <p>I couldn't really say much, but the events of life become recurring sometimes, different roads, but same
            crossroads. I had an office party, a celebration, which became a fun yet memorable experience of my
            life. I've
            been living in Jaipur for quite some time now. I've gone to Badi Chaupar thrice, and it holds a lot of
            bittersweet memories for me. I haven't had time to visit other places much. Anyway, we planned for an
            evening
            above the ground, at Jaipur's famous fort, to really end the day with a royal touch. While my colleagues
            were
            busy taking pictures, I sat down quietly on a wall fence, tripping over city lights as they shone like
            distant
            stars in the twilight of the never-tiring city life. It was a moment of reflection for all the things
            I've been
            doing since I came here, and of how I haven't changed at all.
         </p>
         <p>I saw someone taking pictures of the city beside me. I saw her taking those shots, and I was in her way,
            so I
            gave her some space. Then I controlled myself, but I told her, "You can lower the exposure, the pictures
            will be
            even better." She said, I am also learning these days to click these shots", I did some tweaks on her
            phone, and
            she liked it. I couldn't resist myself, so I asked her to take pictures of herself. I clicked a few, and
            she
            liked them apparently. With just fine adjustments, those portraits looked beautiful. I couldn't believe
            myself,
            so I asked a little about her. She told me about the places she has been to and her experience of the
            city.
         </p>
         <p>It was time to go, my colleagues ordered something, so I had to go. But before going, I mumbled that, "I
            might
            not like to have your contact, there's a beauty to missing someone." I asked her name before going. It
            was
            moments after going that I realized what I couldn't explain to her. I asked my colleague what to do now,
            and she
            told me to "run back". And yeah, that's what I did next, I ran back to the same place and said, "Hey,
            Sandhya,
            I've figured out the equation of what I wanted to say. I told her about my bad experiences of meeting a
            person
            and having to stay in touch with messages back and forth, keeping the relation alive. There's a beauty
            to
            leaving things at open ends after all, we all want someone to miss. She really understood and said, "You
            came
            back now take some more pictures." I happily did.
         </p>
         <p>Then I had to leave I shook hands and left, and that was the evening I was yearning for a long time,
            something
            to make me feel alive and back human. I couldn't calculate if I am ever going to meet her I don't really
            feel
            sad. I feel some good in me and more contentment of what this day has been. Even if I don't get to meet
            Sandhya
            again, but one thing I know for sure how boring my life feels. I know contentment is found in the fort
            on the
            hill. And the evening after that? That's for someone with broken hearts.

         <p>I've come to ideate a lot more, use my imagination for creating beautiful things and designs. It's a
            beautiful
            process. I like the working and mechanism of startups in general, they are indeed a really reactive
            place. Fun
            to work at least, sometimes.
         </p>
         <p>Sometimes the instance of sharing my life with someone is frightening and beautiful simultaneously, but I
            don't
            really agree on the idea of giving myself all out having nothing but dreams of someone. Maybe I am too
            young to
            think that. Sometimes these are the reasons why happiness eludes me. I hate that I grow really specific
            and this
            doesn't work out well with everyone. The really perfect imagery of "the one" in my mind makes me sad of
            what's
            not possible anymore in this world, maybe I've grown in the wrong direction, watered by the fantasies
            and the
            utmost perfect dreams.
         </p>
         <p>I like dancing, but I don't really like going to clubs, that's not really my type I quickly understood.
            If
            burning a pile of cash at midnight (I've got better ideas for doing that) is all to be cool I am an
            outtie here.
            I am not against it, well I do want to hang out in clubs sometimes pretending to be Patrick Bateman from
            American Psycho myself, I can't really do it now, I am not that guy. I actually made a list of the movie
            scenes
            I wanna recreate, obviously the bookshop scene from Notting Hill is one of them, also the Social Network
            dorm
            room hacking scene and a lot of nerdy fan moments.
         </p>
         <p>Oh and also I've outgrown my instant coffee kicks, thanks to my office friends. I don't really use coffee
            as my
            fuel 5 times a day. My days have been filled with challenges and learning curves, but thanks to my
            parents for
            making me strong enough to go through every problem in my life. Also some secret friends from office I
            can't
            really take names of for helping me out and making my little world a better place.

         <p>I as a human have realised that how hard I avoid this fact, I’m aware of what my vulnerabilities are.
            They
            change me as a person. The things I hate about myself are the ones who make me want to walk that extra
            mile in
            life, the ones who don’t let me sleep.

         <div class="post-quote">Coffee-Overflow</div>
         <p>Apologies for the late update. Here’s something I wrote today on Notepad during lunchtime in the office.
         </p>
         <p>Being one with nature is a different concept that actually makes me feel more alive. But there’s another
            kind
            of “oneness” that makes life hell. See this example from my life: I told myself some days ago, “My API
            doesn’t
            work, my life is Hell!”
         </p>
         <p>My life might be hell, but it’s not because of this API problem. It’s just a mask for my deeper internal
            issues. I realized that these daily problems are just a wrapper for my own personal internal struggles.
            Solving
            these won’t have much of an effect on how I perceive the personal hell of my life. Sometimes I have to
            just move
            on, keeping my head down. There’s no other path to redemption other than facing the pain I’ve been
            through, not
            just any pain, but the one that makes me feel alive, the one that gives my life meaning, the one that
            lets me
            sleep in silence, the one that I don’t regret having.
         </p>
         <p>I might be wrong on thousands of endpoints in life, but I might be right here. True oneness will come
            from
            facing my fears, the pain without any escape, having that “bare” conversation with life, wiping off that
            slate
            clean, once and for all. This is the only true liberation. My decisions and choices are heavily
            influenced by
            the way I feel about myself. If self-hate grows at this rate, I might not achieve anything worthwhile in
            life.
            It’s simple math if I can’t love myself, no one else will. Self-love is not just a hoax; it’s a real
            thing now.

         <div class="post-quote">The Emo Turbulence</div>
         <p>Sundays never felt like this one before. While I wanted to fix my life since the beginning of this year,
            I
            overlooked the emotional aspect of it, which now I’m beginning to see lucidly. There’s a certain beauty
            to
            people and things which also get overlooked in a similar manner. I believe now flowers aren’t just
            pretty, they
            are living embodiment of life and they are more than just an earthly thing. Something things of beauty
            hold a
            very special relation to me, and they just stay close to my heart. While you might not be able to
            decipher
            everything I’m saying, I believe someone just found my decryption key.

            spare
            some free time during lunch to write something for my blog. It’s certainly got an officey feel to it,
            which is a

            pretty rough and I’ve tried my best to make it better, and my efforts they seem to go in a good
            direction now.
            I’ve joined a startup as a SDE Intern, I always considered startups as that group of crazy people trying

            solutions to
            all the problems in my life. this isn’t me. Maybe I’m that other kid who loves to put his mind to work,

            process I am a sucker for. these days more than learning something, learning to learn something seems
            more
            exciting, the process feels more complete and fulfilling. well it is one of the many things I am
            learning these

         <div class="post-quote">Hovering Floppy</div>
         <p>“It finally feels like a save game moment…”</p>
         <p>Back during summer in my fifth or sixth grade year, I was hooked on playing games on my computer. One
            thing I
            noticed was that most games, like GTA and Total Overdose, they had this floppy disk hovering at certain
            points,
            indicating the save game location. This was where I could save all my hard-earned progress from
            completing
            missions. But wait.. why am I telling you this? Yesterday was one of those save game moments for me, and
            the
            location was Jaipur, Rajasthan. It started a few weeks ago with an online interview at a startup that
            went well.
            This week, I went there for an in-person interview, which was different because most of my previous
            interviews,
            except for the Air Force one, were conducted online. I was a little nervous about how it would turn out.
         </p>
         <p>The night before the interview, I couldn’t sleep much, not out of fear, but because my mind wouldn’t stop
            even
            though my body desperately wanted to rest. It kept running through different scenarios, most of them
            untrue.
            Short on sleep, I had to wake up early to catch the train. It was a pleasant ride with beautiful salt
            fields,
            especially the red ones. To keep my spirits high, I played some Coldplay music. After arriving, I took
            the metro
            and walked 4 km to the interview location. I was sweating profusely but I made it. I grabbed a random
            book,
            opened a page, and started reading until I was called in. The interview lasted about 45 minutes. I
            remember
            looking at the whiteboard and thought of using it, so I presented a system I had designed recently. I
            know I
            could have presented a better design if I had gotten better REM sleep. The interview shifted towards
            philosophical questions, which provided me with a better platform to express myself and my thoughts. I
            felt more
            articulate. After the interview, I waited outside while reading a book about death that was on the
            table. I dove
            headfirst into some thoughts until I was called back into the room an hour later. They informed me that
            I had
            gotten the job! in an official way.
         </p>
         <p>I had to call Ritik and tell him the news. Then, I went to a local cafe and ordered some maggi to eat, as
            I
            hadn’t had much breakfast. I called Ritik, telling him every detail. Finally, I caught a breath. The
            weather was
            pleasant, overcast and cool or should I say it was “my kinda weather”. I sat there quietly for a while,
            simply
            feeling the cool breeze on my face, finally relaxing. I was happy. Next, I met Nandini as we had planned
            after
            the interview. I took the metro to meet her area and then spent hours talking, walking around the area,
            visiting
            parks and cafes, and finally going for some Udupi food & Filter coffee, I remember the bell they had put
            up on
            every table to call someone for the order or the bill it caught my attention and it was a polite way of
            summoning someone for a work, I found it a great place to go around. then finally saying goodbye to her.
            Now the
            next thing was to come back home, I was slightly tired, but I didn’t want to stop exploring, so I
            continued to
            discover other areas before catching a late train. I waited for hours at the station, taking trips to
            different
            platforms, my legs aching from all the walking. Finally, I dozed off on the train.
         </p>
         <p>Yes, this was the day, “the save game moment”, that I will share with others. But you, my friend, already
            know
            about it before I even tell you. you know all my secrets and the tricks I keep up my sleeves. Sometimes
            I see
            there’s something more to my life’s struggles and problems which I can’t completely decipher today, but
            we’ll
            see it together, right?

         <div class="post-quote">"Alive"</div>
         <p>There are some things on my mind that I've been holding in these days, and I must write them now. Well,
            firstly, I've slowed down in my search for good projects. Is it a lack of motivation? I don't know
            clearly, but
            possibly yes, or it might be due to a lack of positive responses that I think I should've gotten by now.
            But
            whatever it may be, I must keep going until I land something I want, which is to say, a good role in a
            company I
            want to work with.
         </p>
         <p>My cold emails these days are sparse in numbers, but I want to ramp them up again this time, rise like I
            always
            do, even better than last time. All these days and experiences have made me understand the importance of
            getting
            challenged in life. I would love to get my butt kicked by time, the sooner the better, before I stagnate
            or end
            up on the wrong path. At this point in my life, I don't want to get comfortable at home or at work. I
            want to
            come home every day eager to learn new things. I don't seek stability; I crave growth. All the quotes
            I've heard
            tell me it's uncomfortable, and I do want that in my life.
         </p>
         <p>I don't want to come home every day with nothing meaningful to do or succumb to the slow, tempting
            comfort of a
            bedroom. I want meaning in my life, and I'm going to strive for that for myself, not to fulfill someone
            else's
            dreams. Obviously, I'm not blinded by ambition to overlook the importance of the people in my life, nor
            do I
            want to give up the simplicity of life I have now. The idea of working on something at a desk for hours
            seems
            more satisfying than aimlessly sacrificing my sleep and well-being for others who don't truly value me.
         </p>
         <p>I really want to hit the gym again. But this time, I want to be full of energy every day, preserving some
            for
            the gym. No beating around the bush, I like feeling exhausted, giving it my all every day. That makes me
            feel
            more alive, kind of weird, isn't it? I loved that feeling of watching montages from Rocky & Creed and
            going for
            the next round. Last time I made some mistakes working out, like not having enough energy or not eating
            properly. I realize that no matter how many small mistakes I identify and fix in myself, there's always
            room for
            improvement. It's the will and the fire that truly take you far. Also, it feels like "home is where I
            am."
            Wherever I go, I carry the good and the bittersweet experiences with me. Sometimes, contentment is all I
            need,
            and when I have it, my geographical location doesn't matter much to me.

         <p>"Where do I even begin? Now, I'll just start out somewhere in between and try to cover both the ending &
            starting points" I'm in the midst of a crowd of thousands in a big bustling mall in New Delhi and I'm
            mentally
            thinking about mentioning this experience in my blog, yeah I was currently 2 days ahead of myself
            thinking about
            this very moment when I'll mention about what happened.
         </p>
         <p>Through some family work I got to go to Delhi for one day. As usual my response was "Hell Yeah!" not
            looking
            forward for the work but for a chance to be myself again, wander some unknown streets, meet some new
            people, get
            out of the small box I live in (not my home). It took a 10-hour train journey to get there, and some
            sleep cut
            short. But it was worth it, as the morning began, I walked down the streets of New Delhi, carefully
            looking for
            my phone, as it has been seen people are fond of using other's phones more often there. I would've lost
            my only
            camera that day :)
         </p>
         <p>I wandered streets following arbitrary turns my mind commanded me to take. I walked for a couple of hours
            before coming back to where I was staying. It got decided to go to a Select city which was in a close
            vicinity
            next. Forward to some time later I was standing in this crowd of thousands of people I never met, all
            different
            to me, all separated from me by huge gaps of culture and lifestyle. I saw people, different people. I
            come from
            a small, not-so-populous city of Jodhpur, also not as developed as metro cities in some ways, but what I
            saw the
            most was a cultural shift there. I shouldn't be going to describe the semantics here.
         </p>
         <p>I don't know how I exactly felt that moment or what the correct word for that is, but I didn't seem to
            blend
            into that crowd. I felt everything at once in that moment: This pressure of life I am not able to
            handle, this
            box living I'm not made for. I heard the world calling me, the life I always wanted, the work I always
            wanted,
            the happiness I always wanted, and yet I saw myself bound by the chains of luck, failure, and misery
            which I
            couldn't seem to break. After that moment, I felt a sudden relief through my body. That moment was a
            realization. It was more than just a mere part of time; it came to me and I soaked it in myself.
         </p>
         <p>Then I continued seeing some other places visiting here and there and then finally taking a metro back to
            the
            station. What I think is that people there travel a lot in metro, this being their easiest commute
            possible.
            They spend a significant amount of time traveling in it only to realize that a good amount of time has
            passed
            by. "Thus life moves fast in a tube."
         </p>
         <p>I was happy that I got to experience this in my life. Delhi became more than a city for me. I really
            enjoyed
            the rest of my time there. In fact, I would plan to go there again soon. I loved the city.
         </p>
         <p>I didn't take any rest, but I had to go to Pokhran the same day I returned from Delhi. Well, it was a
            marriage
            after all. Unlike the traditional city marriages, I found it actually intelligent who marry in smaller
            cities/towns. It's a small and tightly knit bond what they have, not much of a show for people to watch
            but
            definitely worth going to. The main highlight which I enjoyed was the clear weather or I say
            pollution-free
            skies, that striked like a thunderbolt inside my mind to capture what? Stars. Yeah, I wouldn't lie, but
            this was
            one of the most beautiful night skies I've captured yet. It's just beautiful. I still couldn't believe
            capturing
            cosmic giants other than the stars and moon; this time I got to capture even Nebulas! It initially
            skipped my
            eyes too, until someone made me notice. I just couldn't take my eyes off the sight. Aaah, it's a great
            feeling.
            If you wanna see, make sure your brightness is higher and zoom in on the colorful pixels which you can
            see. Here
            are the shots. This was unreal.

         <p>"Oh I am young again, this was all a day dream, as cold tears streamed down my face I said, thanks for
            waking
            me up" I wished this was true. but it isn't true right? There will be no day dream that ends and wakes
            me as a
            different person a person far away from pain and despair, woken into an alternate reality where I am the
            protagonist of my own life. The more I think about this whole day dreaming thing, the more I wished It
            was true,
            but I had to move on, I had to really "wake up". I have this ache in my soul to touch that blurry
            infinite
            thing.. that infinite echo of terminal I could never see the end of...
         </p>
         <p>Well this was just the internal chatter talk going inside my mind when I'm alone. but there isn't any
            stopping
            to what I create with the free compute resources of my own cloud head, this whole idea of
            pre-colonisation era
            of humanity excites me everything from the daily lifestyle, the society, the peasants, the kings how
            would've
            they lived? Sadly there isn't a way to get back in time and experience that all.. but if we all do live
            in a
            computer simulation there must be some existing cheatcodes to these lives which are human players
            haven't found
            yet.. Oh how classic foolishery that would be.. well someone must say we are not as evolved as we think
            we
            are...
         </p>
         <p>But wait if there's a matrix or simulation then there must be some lag in between the events of this
            life, how
            miniscule that might be, it must be there.. is that the difference it takes between a person considered
            as 1 or
            0? if so isn't life so short as comparable to a network lag between two states, all the emotions,
            memories we
            hold just disappear into thin air. it is frightening and calming at the same time, why you ask? I'd say
            it is
            what it is.

         <p>I have my GATE exam tomorrow, and to be honest, I haven't prepared well. I did cover a few subjects from
            the
            course last year, but that came to a halt when my results were announced. I have to start a sound
            preparation
            for next year's exam from this month only to get a good score. I believe in myself that I'll do well,
            once and
            for all. I have to consider other career options after college. I should be researching that now, and
            I'll do it
            soon. Go abroad? That does seem exhilarating to me. "Leave everything at midnight and go to some country
            that I
            love and that doesn't know me, that was always the plan" (just joking, no real plans like this). If I
            have to do
            this, I won't leave anything in between before moving to the next part of life.
         </p>
         <p>I don't have the classic dilemma for the subject choices I want to go for; that has always been a
            constant
            variable. "Constant-variable" isn't that a bit fishy sounding? Also, I am working on getting an
            internship
            again. Well, this is the same process as last year, but this time my character seems to have gotten some
            charismatic upgrades. This time it will be a little tougher process than last year as I seem to have
            some
            constraints (financial+academic), but I ain't giving up on anything. I am headed in a good direction for
            now.
            I'm trying to be a better man.
         </p>
         <p>For what I'm hearing these days This one has gotten me to love music once again in a bustling life, being
            the
            center point of my thoughts and my good mood. It just steals a piece straight out of my heart. There's a
            good
            chance you'll find me humming this these days, I also want to go for ice skating too, straight up
            inspired by
            Rocky, but yeah, it does seem a geographical satire considering my current location. Don't know, it
            seems to me
            different than adventure sports, but why? The answer to which my buggered heart doesn't know.
         </p>
         <p>*A sneak peek into my mind* "What is it really that lets me sleep well? Or more precisely, what is it
            about
            life that calms me?" Believe it or not, but questioning life has become a new hobby of mine. Not that I
            question
            everyone on the street, but now I do challenge my faith that I've held for a long time, like the simple
            trust
            bonds I have with different people, also the default settings my relationship with other people is. Is
            it good
            or bad to challenge my faith? I don't know the answer, but I do seem to notice that the more I challenge
            my
            faith or opinions about something, the stronger it gets. There's an initial friction to this thought,
            but
            bypassing it is rewarding. I do seem to notice that not changing anything and just letting things come
            in my way
            isn't satisfying as well. The small differences I make to my life make a huge difference to thoughts and
            the way
            I see myself.
         </p>
         <p>Also I fear of being adapting to the easyness of life which is a red pill blue pill situation again,
            either I
            wake up to the reality or I sleep and think it was all just daydreams, the things that other people say
            so
            casually sometimes touches me deep within, it scares me to be ordinary to be someone who is a perfect
            fit by
            this society, this fear of this constant bondage that this society implies on me & my free running
            thoughts
            constantly, I hate to say it but I feel like I'm the Julius Caesar of this dystopian world. maybe I
            think too
            much, or did I take the blue pill last night after dinner?

         <div class="post-quote">Should I blog about it or let it slip?</div>
         <p>I'd prefer the former option. I had my interview for my internship yesterday, and it just didn't go as
            planned.
            I can say that the reason is me. I didn't prepare well this time. I learned SQL a few days earlier, but
            it
            didn't work out, as I hadn't covered the advanced sections, which were probably the important ones I
            missed. I
            blanked out during the interview, and halfway through, I knew the result already. I felt shame in a part
            where I
            wanted to leave it, but that was not an option for me. I could see many ways where I went wrong. It was
            one of
            the first interviews I had that went this terribly.
         </p>
         <p> I felt low after giving it, and the reason was clear as hell. I just didn't feel like discussing it with
            anyone after that. I felt collapsing inward. But I am writing this to remember the next time I go for
            bigger
            things in my life. It will be a remembrance that it wasn't all rainbows and sunshine I went through. I
            don't
            want to forget yesterday for what it was. It wasn't my inability to answer some questions I didn't know,
            it was
            me who was unable. In this light-speed life, the rush in my heart to skip things seems a perfect option,
            but I
            know it isn't the way I'm meant to go. I'd never be a failure if someone else said so. It'll probably be
            me who
            has given up on his dreams and ambitions for something smaller, shallower, which he never wanted. I must
            go
            through this for what may seem a tough time to others and partly to me but is actually a path to
            realisation for
            me.
         </p>
         <p>If life ever gets all sorted out or good, I would remember that it wasn't easy, even though I cried my
            tears
            never fell in shallow waters.

         <p>“Yeah it was Battlefield I, which came to my mind at the end.”</p>
         <p>This is a story about someone close to me who challenged my thinking about life in many ways and even
            changed
            it, she goes by the name Anna Scott (changed it). although she seems to have come from notting hill, she
            indeed
            is one from sense and sensibility for me. Although I haven’t met her in real life, I can feel her
            presence
            within my mind and thoughts. I met Anna in an online community, which I joined because it seemed
            interesting.
            She had a unique perspective on life that set her apart. I was genuinely impressed by her intelligence,
            which
            was evident from the very start. For the first few months, I didn’t even know her full name, which was a
            reflection of my foolishness. It took me a challenging 10-day game to know her full name, and that’s
            when I
            realized how patient and fun she could be, two qualities rarely found together. I admired her for that.
            Before
            all this I had hit a rough patch in my life, where my trust and belief in love was over and I became a
            free
            bird, not waiting for anyone to come and help me.
         </p>
         <p>Over time, I gradually got to know her better. I would ask about her day, her college life, her
            interests, and
            her life journey so far. She was an intriguing person, and we shared some common interests, especially
            our
            determination towards each other. Talking to her gave me a sense of excitement and longing that I hadn’t
            felt in
            a long time. It wasn’t my fault she truly was an impressive individual. I was falling for her, one day
            at a
            time, and affection was growing in my heart, a feeling I cherished. After all, she was smart, and I
            never
            doubted her. I never knew much internet slangs before I started talking to her, but she taught me many,
            some I
            use till this day, like “Kyool”.
         </p>
         <p>She was not only intelligent but also, I believed, beautiful, although I had never seen her face at that
            time.
            We spent months talking to each other every day at the same time, and this routine continued. I even got
            to know
            her name and added her on my instagram. When I felt like I was becoming a “lovebug,” I gathered the
            courage to
            tell her about my feelings in January. It was an online scribble match one evening when I shared that I
            had
            started to develop feelings for her. However, my dreams didn’t unfold as planned. I first scribbled some
            characters, and we played for a while then and I wrote, “I have developed strong feelings for you and I
            never
            saw you..” well she was out of words to say.
         </p>
         <p>She pointed out that it would be difficult for us to be together and that there was no possibility of a
            deeper
            connection. I understood her perspective. Unlike other girls, she was always kind to me. I think She
            knew I
            wasn’t ready for a relationship, and that I had many things to figure out in my life. She was right, and
            I
            appreciated her honesty. She was becoming the girl of my morning dreams, someone I would be fortunate to
            have in
            my life.
         </p>
         <p>At some point, my feelings for her grew intense, and I found myself taking photos of coconut trees
            whenever I
            saw them. They reminded me of the coconut plantations in South India, where she was from. Anna seemed a
            bit
            concerned that my feelings were getting too strong, while I worried about whether I was causing her
            discomfort.
            We decided to stop talking for a while, but I couldn’t get her off my mind. I couldn’t find a
            replacement for
            her, as I did with other things in life. I had many friends to keep me company, but none were quite like
            her. I
            missed her sense of humor and our daily conversations, even though I had never seen her face. I still
            have a few
            photos of her that she shared with me, which was a small consolation.
         </p>
         <p>One day, I confided in a friend about my strong desire to see her face and hear her voice. She suggested
            I
            should just ask her, so I did. Unfortunately, she politely declined my request. In my free time, I would
            search
            the internet to learn more about her city, its culture, and the beaches, but it didn’t quell my longing
            for her.
            February 23 was a significant month in our story, and I knew I had to meet her somehow. I applied for
            many
            internships in her state that were similar and in line with my profile, for all the institutes I knew,
            and one
            morning while walking to the bus for my college, I checked my email and received an acceptance offer
            from her
            city. I was thrilled at the prospect of going there, but what happened next would alter the course of my
            life.
         </p>
         <p>I asked about this situation with Anna and told her about my plans of her city and staying with her,
            while I
            promised her before that I’d meet her someday, in her city. I had other good internship offers, but I
            chose her
            city because I was getting impatient to meet her. After talking with her, though, I realized I might be
            making a
            mistake by sacrificing a good career opportunity. So, after some contemplation, I shifted my decision.
            My new
            destination became Trichy (Still close to her), a decision that turned out to be one of the best I had
            made in
            years. However, I was determined to meet her in her city at least once during my time there, and she
            agreed to
            meet me once, so it was a happy time for me. I was happy with travelling thousands of kilometers just to
            see her
            once for one evening. I actually wanted to suprise her by showing up at her college without informing
            her, that
            was the plan atleast, but I saw some flaws in this one as this would give her more shock than
            excitement, so
            this one got discarded.
         </p>
         <p>After spending a few days in Trichy, I decided to discuss the possibility of meeting Anna with her. I had
            my
            tickets ready and inquired if we could finally arrange a time for us to meet. However, due to personal
            reasons,
            she declined and suggested that I come after a festival. I agreed, remaining patient. But as my days in
            Trichy
            were drawing to a close and I asked once more, she refused to meet me, this time, for good. I vividly
            recall
            that morning, it left me feeling deeply disheartened. Internally, I felt fragemented. I took a day off
            from work
            and stayed in my room alone, avoiding the office that day. I was angry with myself. It built up in my
            head.
         </p>
         <p>I couldn’t quite comprehend why she made that decision. I knew for sure she didn’t intend to hurt me, but
            somehow, it had happened. This experience made me realize how intricate life can be and even her
            smallest of
            decisions profoundly impact my life.
         </p>
         <p>Overall, I believed it was over. We continued texting regularly for a few more days, but then in August,
            I
            informed her that I was going to deactivate my Instagram account. Subsequently, I chose to sever the
            connection
            between us, leaving our story incomplete. I began to doubt whether I could ever carve a place in her
            heart, even
            though I had hoped to do so. She had become a significant part of my dreams and letting go proved to be
            a
            challenging task. For months of her absence, it felt like a void feeling, something that’ll come when
            you lose
            someone close to you, There was no doubt she was close to my heart. I thought of sharing this feeling of
            missing
            Anna with my friends, but these constant thoughts of Anna would make them think that I’d gone insane, so
            I kept
            these to myself. Fast forward to today, this has become one of the events in my past life, something I
            can never
            respawn myself to relive again. If there’s any regret in me it’s getting more of that feeling of my
            heart
            pounding, that adrenaline racing in my veins, and that feeling of reaching an oasis in my mind after a
            long
            string of never-ending sunny days.
         </p>
         <p>After all this I tried being with other people for a while, but it never worked out, because of what, you
            ask?
            it was me probably, I couldn’t be that person I was with anna, never that same shubham again, that
            feeling never
            kicked back in my blood again, that feeling aah! just the memories of spending imagining about that
            evening that
            never happened, were more pleasent sometimes than being with another stranger (I understand it’s not
            fair to
            live this way). I stopped trying, to pretend someone I can be, I just didn’t try, left it completely.
            while my
            words might sound more poetic than practical. but lemme tell you I thought the same when I read
            something like
            this, being on the other side now, I feel it deeply, far beyond the small limits of practicality. While
            I am
            writing and recalling all this, many bitter-sweet feelings race through my mind, but there’s some future
            to this
            which I can’t predict now, but it is for time to tell. I owe anna this story, for all her kindness and
            friendship that meant so much to me when I needed her the most, I cannot forget that. As I write this
            she must
            be 22, Though I remember her birthday this January, this whole aftermath just goes in my mind and I
            couldn’t
            wish her.
            I am a changed man now, I don’t ever rest now, there’s no home for my thoughts and my body, I love this
            this
            life of a wanderer, without having a “point B” in my life, to sit at every bench in life I want and
            start
            walking again, with no desire to reach any end, just to see life as endlessly as I can, to never stop
            for anyone
            or anything that I don’t want. a ordinary life doesn’t intersts me anymore, after all this I fear of
            being
            ordinary in this world, I fear of falling for someone like anna and I don’t want to settle now, never.
         </p>
         <p>And that’s my story “A lost boy who loved a stranger more than ever, in doing so he found himself a new
            feeling
            he never knew he had”. Things get mixed up with time and you’ll probably hear other versions, “A mad boy
            who
            went way far away, then made a fool of himself”. But what you heard from me is the truth, I wouldn’t
            tell you if
            it wasn’t, would I?

         <p>The thing about the moon and city lights is that they create a particularly large glare in my night shots
            (a
            good 1/3 portion of it). I am intrigued about how I can counter this phenomenon — there must be some
            way, at
            least that professionals use, and something specific for my use case. Well, all I can say for now is
            that it
            adds a good effect to this particular shot (apparently). You can see all of them here. I’ve tried
            listening to
            music while I click these photos at night, and it lifts up the complete experience of capturing stars at
            night.
            Oh and if you didn’t zoom in on the images i shared, you missed some important details, besides the
            regularly
            shining pole stars there are some dwarf ones you can only see when you zoom in on them.
         </p>
         <p>So, an interview is coming up again next week, this time for a data analytics role, and I am not nervous
            about
            it this time. I’ll prepare as a soldier, sneaky and sharp for all the traps coming my way. Now, from
            today
            onwards I’ll be preparing for the technical interview with a changed approach. Usually, I start from
            scratch for
            every problem or interview chance I have, but this time I’ll build on top of the things I already know.
            One
            thing I always missed is the question I am given at the end of the call to ask. But this time (I knew
            it), and I
            asked about the team in detail I’ll be working with and what we’ll be building eventually, this has
            given me
            some pointers for what to focus specifically and foremost to other things. So, got a headstart now. I
            have
            contributed to some open source projects before, but working on high-level markup or JS has never
            interested me.
            What I eventually want to do is contribute to operating systems like Ubuntu. I understand that it takes
            experience to contribute to such low-level programs, but seeing my name in the contributors list of
            open-source
            operating systems such as Ubuntu or Kali is a dream of mine.
         </p>
         <p>One particular thought I have, which should not be led by open source — but it’s my blog, and I’ll do it
            is
            that I see pain and sadness as two different things now. Of course, they are two different words, but
            somehow
            their coexistence exists in our lives. Pain actually breeds solutions, I’d say. In my life, countering
            it
            requires doing something every time. Putting effort into something I love relieves my pain, and doing
            that
            sometimes requires a spark within. In short, pain is useful as it pushes me to do something I haven’t
            done, to
            push my boundaries, or to simply blow my thinking cap once again! I’ve had my fair share of pain in
            different
            forms, sometimes physical, sometimes inner. It’s not the best thing I’d want in my life; it hurts me,
            causes
            sleepless nights, takes away the comfort of those daily moments and things I enjoy. It breaks me, makes
            me think
            about life harder again, that it’s not over yet and I’m not done. I respect pain now for what it is and
            for what
            it pushes me to do. I am not at peace with pain, and I’ll never be it hurts me, and it makes me feel
            alive
            again, in the end, “pain has the right to be felt.”

         <p>“chachu yeh dekho itne sare pakshi” (look at there are so many birds at once) he said, it reminded of how
            simple happiness for him is, seeing so many birds freely flying at once, he danced in his own way. this
            evening
            while I was walking him to a local temple, as he’s used to going daily there. he told me that he has a
            friend
            who lives across the street and she changed school before studying in the same class with him, he seemed
            a bit
            down by this, though he doesn’t remember in his daily life it is still a memory of him, a profound one.
            I am at
            my mother’s home currently, it’s outside of the city far away from the thin air of light speed life.
            he’s my
            brother but still he says me “chachu” because I’m his only big brother and everyone else is a chachu, so
            he’s
            not bothered by saying me chachu. happiness for him isn’t a complex entity it’s just the things he
            doesn’t
            expects from anyone else, he seems to make some for himself. when I see him it reminds of how life
            changes over
            year, for once I was of his age, asking these questions, and how many years have passed by, I always
            thought
            that life is endless and my imaginations would always run wild without any bounds, but growing up has
            instilled
            this time factor into me, that constanly reminds of my mortal nature and the things i have been losing
            since, i
            have decided, not to let time take control over my life or letting things happen as they happen, I don’t
            want to
            be another person in this “one size fits all” and look at myself unmotivated and sad. I had a messed up
            childhood, not particularly bad in any way, but I was a big mess in my past and there were only a few
            balancing
            points in my life which I don’t want to lose. even messed up I never gave up on anything and I continue
            not to.

         <p>It’s not much late but my eyes are heavy already, I haven’t wrote about my life these days, but it’s
            time. I
            wrote something, few days prior to today, I wrote a blog entry I had to delete, don’t know if someone
            read that
            but it was something I’ve been feeling from a while now, so I wrote to take it off my mind and it did
            help a
            little, I was angry about some events of the past and it took a toll on my mind, I don’t speak about
            openly, but
            hey this is my blog and I’m allowed to speak here, the thing is I find it hard to follow social
            conventions, it
            applies to a large range of them, starting from personal things, I didn’t struggle with this in my
            chilhood as I
            accepted everything with closed eyes, it’s not comforting to challenge everything you see, it makes you
            seem
            like a social outcast.
         </p>
         <p>Acutally what I think personally is to do lesser things this year, hear me out, doing more things !=
            Completing
            all the things, also more things crowd my mind, means I have lesser free time to include some new
            changes and
            also not completing the things I initially set out is a kind of upsetting thing as well.
         </p>
         <p>I noticed one particular thing about me that I lack taking initiative in real life, sometimes it’s always
            a
            push or seeing someone do things makes me want to do them to, this is not a good thing I guess, let’s
            say I want
            to learn, “X” I usually do it only when I see someone learning “X”, and then as a part of the reaction I
            have to
            account for the lost time and the learning curve when I am learning. inshort, I need to build my own
            roads now
            before I see other walking on their own, Have you heard about building walls? not the actual physical
            ones or
            the firewalls, I’m talkin mental barriers, the things I build inside my head to protect myself or kinda
            my rain
            catcher, isn’t that cool? but doing so always makes me feel vulnerable or it points out i have some
            gaping holes
            in my mental system. that’s why It becomes hectic/painful to set boundaries is indeed a huge
            improvement, not
            only it allows me to better think of myslef but also it saves me from doing things i don’t want to, say
            If I
            never wanted to ask out a girl and I do it because I feel more good, that will always be bad decision
            (everybody
            knows that) that’s what I feel is a problem, the solution to that is simple for me, create boundaries
            but expand
            them constanly, and then I should carefully choose the next things i want to add to myself.
         </p>
         <p>lastly, before I start studying back now, I wanted to tell ya something, I had a on call interview
            (Technical)
            today for a internship position in a comapany at Hyd, it was afternon I was making some project from
            youtube, I
            picked the call and I agreed to answer his questions, he asked me about some projects and the skills I
            wrote in
            my CV, he asked me how to delete a directory in linux, WTF! I forgot it! The one good thing I did for
            years and
            I forgot, neither did I wanted to make a google search sabotaging my reputation nor stay quite, I tried
            a few
            guess like “cls”, “-r” luckily the late was the answer I checked it just now. he asked me about my
            experience in
            “CNN” and I blanked out this time, with nothing to say I just told I have a little experience but I’m
            not
            confident here, I didn’t answer a simple python question, about “mutable/immutable” data types I didn’t
            do good
            here lastly few things about my experience with Raspberry pico, i handled this one well and then finally
            I got
            to explain about the wrong answer, I said I follow a “learn and build approach” building things as I
            learn from
            docs/tutorials not simply mugging like I used to do before, he told me finally someone will get in touch
            in a
            few days, I don’t know if they will.. but it’s for us to see.
         </p>

         <p>What did your ideal future self look like? Mine was a cooler version of Shubham — yeah, sometimes all I
            wanted
            was to be a more “cooler” version of myself. Thankfully, I didn’t try smoking, but it was a significant
            part of
            what I thought a happier future me would be like. For me, being cool meant knowing everything happening
            in the
            world of the internet, computers, science, and sci-fi. It played a major role in how I spent my time in
            school.
            Although I was a mildly naughty kid, in contrary I was, a shy one too. I remember crying in my science
            class
            over a petty argument with my friend. I even told my teacher, but she didn’t do anything, and I could
            hear my
            echo of crying at that time. Well, if someone from school is reading this, you might remember me as that
            quirky/anti-normal kid trying to do random weird stuff he saw on the internet. Although I wasn’t the
            best in
            studies, the conventional system of making notebooks and files seemed upsetting and boring to me. But I
            liked
            making PPTs because, for that, I was given some free money to go to the cybercafe and spend time on the
            computer. I never really had access to the internet until the ninth class — it was mostly accessible
            through
            smartphones or using postpaid dongles for computers, of which I had neither. But when I got my first
            computer at
            about 12 years of age, it was initially about running different software, going to local stores for
            installing
            games/software on the system. I became fond of some first-person games like Vice City, Condition Zero,
            Call of
            Duty, Halo, PvZ, Need for Speed, etc. It didn’t had speakers so had to use the inbuilt less louder ones,
            Then
            slowly, I shifted to the building side of it, like removing the hard disk while the computer is on or
            removing
            the side of the CPU to see internals, disconnecting various ribbon cables, and trying to make some sense
            out of
            my work. Learning some tricks and tips that I thought were cool to learn and show other people, like
            remembering
            the different hex values of colors to point out people in class. It was all fun. As time passed, I
            realized that
            these little things that I love really very much were the things keeping me stable and happy, even
            though I was
            not a big shot in studies. I stayed happy, or as they say, “fulfilled.” My confidence was built on it; I
            felt
            more confident the more I knew stuff. It helped me keep my head high in school life, make friends, and
            approach
            other people. These little things that I did in the past had an everlasting effect on my mind, which is
            how I
            think every day. It is what I always wanted to become. While I looked for passion every day in life when
            everyone told me to search for it, it was actually in my conversations (even the sad/dull ones), the
            things I
            talked about the most, the things that excited me the most, and I, being a fool, searched for it like it
            was an
            object.
         </p>
         <p>P.S. As my exams are approaching an end now, it’s a new start for me, and I want to begin a new chapter,
            this
            time more focused and more specific, without a burning heart but a mind eager to see more of life in
            this time —
            a “me” time I wanted and to never look back at things again, to learn like a child again, this time in
            an
            unknown city in south india.

         <p>My exams will be starting soon again so I better get preparing for that now, I’ve did some portion
            actually and
            hoping to cover a big chunk which is still left, So it’ll be a short marathon from now, won’t consider
            it as a
            sprint, exams as usual have always been a marathon, it’s has became a common thing, my mind always
            delves into
            thinking about what I’ll be doing after exams, which has became disastrous at times. now I need to
            muffle that
            part for some time, while I do the task at hand, Applying a BFS approach now for my studies. I’ve also
            got to
            tackle some anxiety along, which is important to stay away from at this time.
         </p>
         <p>I’ve wondered what would be the test results of today so I again took some long exposure shots, this time
            manually adjusting the parameters so I can gain more clearer shots, you can obviously see them here I’ve
            just
            uploaded today’s shots now, while observing this I saw a intersting phenomenon which usually made my
            shot a bit
            whitewashed but the reason was citylights! Now I know why can’t I see most of the stars these days and
            thus the
            need for long exposure even for closer stars. in the lower right corner of the picture you can see a bit
            washed
            out area (in hyperbolic shape) which was indeed coming from the streetlights, or from homes etc. while
            the
            nature is aesthetic in it’s own, seeing it from that perspective lowers the beauty sometimes and
            eventually
            leading it to fade in the eyes of beholder, that’s why I wish to keep this results to a few peopple
            only, to
            accept things the way they look sometimes is the best css you can apply to it, even though these aren’t
            the best
            looking pictures in the world, I like the feeling of staring and zooming at them, boy If had a large
            telescope
            I’d scout some exoplanets, the pleasure of naming them must be overflowing I think, until another
            species
            argues, but it’s fun anyways :) so I must do some work now, the night is long and I am anything but
            resting,
            through nights and days I shall pass, let the stars be my guide and sun be my lamp I shall walk through
            the
            deserts & grassy plains of life to see that horizon I was living for, until then I should keep up :)

         <div class="post-quote">The Instagram Propogation</div>
         <p>“It’s different.”, Just two days ago, on New Year’s Eve, I spontaneously reactivated my Instagram and
            then
            thought, “Why not clear my head now?” I went live and announced to everyone that I will be building
            something
            I’ve long desired to create. Not only that, but I cleared my mind of everything I held within it. I’m
            uncertain
            of the effect it will have, but it matters to me. It was a bold move for someone like me, who barely
            tries to
            keep up with trends and has never gone live before. I told everyone about what I’ll be doing, Most
            people might
            have expected a New Year’s Eve party or something which is quite unusual for a nerd like me, who rarely
            changes
            his hoodie (never did, just mentioning for context).
         </p>
         <p>I’m eager to create something — a super techy product that’s niche yet immensely useful to a select group
            of
            people. Over the next six months, this is my primary goal. I want to build something like a linchpin, an
            indispensable creation or something like “tinyurl” which is a simple yet cool thing to build. I have
            some
            small-scale ideas. What can I say, I’ve spent quite a alone time now, far away from most of the thing I
            used to
            be surrounded with also, I’ve realized that the notion of a “BIG LIFE” is an even bigger lie. Let me
            explain.
            While it might appeal to some, it’s certainly not my cup of tea. I cherish the smaller moments that,
            when
            compiled, form the essence of life as we understand it. I’ve understood that most of the things that
            appeal to
            me, such as a top-notch internship or even traveling with companions, can’t resolve my life’s
            complexities and
            dilemmas. It simply can’t. What they can do, however, is alter my environment, maintain clarity in
            thinking, or
            give me time & space to care about myself. Instead of fixating on the flashy things that grab my
            attention, I’ve
            often diverted my focus there, believing that a superior internship could solve my life. Yet, the truth
            remains
            — the constant in both the “before” and “after” phases is me.
         </p>
         <p>While I live many lives at once, I seem to forget mine, bound by expectations, aspirations, and time.
            well, I
            don’t want to make Barnum statements, but I also don’t want to live others’ lives. Yes, I have been
            doing so
            until now, attempting to save relationships with holes that can’t be fixed today, dragging down with me
            my time,
            peace, and, importantly, my happiness.
         </p>
         <p>Just moments ago, while heading to my terrace, I spotted some stars, or better yet, CONSTELLATIONS. I
            took some
            long exposure shots to capture the shining stars better. Quickly, I got on my computer and ran a check
            for the
            constellation names — indeed, there were more than one. This is what I found.. I am writing this blog
            since a
            prolonged time, I’ll try to stick to writing back again now besides all the rollercoaster ride of my
            life..

         <p>“To every heaven and hell that reside within me, I’m deeply aware.”</p>
         <p>In the midst of these Dark days, I aim to live a perspective that celebrates life’s myriad blessings and
            holds
            hope in every corner. Are our bright moments the sole memories that define us? There was a time when I
            feared
            they might wield that power, but no more. This phase of seeking solace in solitude has become somewhat
            addictive, a sanctuary from the pain. Yet, within this seclusion, I find comfort in the simple routines
            of daily
            life — pedaling to college, relishing breakfast at fixed hours. These commonplace yet soothing rituals
            served as
            the focal point in my fragmented world.
         </p>
         <p>Sadly, nothing seems to stir my interest anymore. it has became boring to be not excited by the bits and
            bytes
            of the internet flowing through my network but something in the real world. which is the source of all
            the life
            that I have— the very essence of life. My future remains blurred, will I continue in circular motions or
            leap
            beyond the threshold I’ve always envisioned? The answer, I couldn’t know.
         </p>
         <p>Depression, has firmly seeped itself in my life. It began several months ago, a bad semester result that
            disrupted my reality beyond my tunnel vision. The corridors of my college, once vibrant, now carry an
            cold air
            of desolation. Those familiar paths where friendships blossomed, where a mere nod brought smiles, now
            lie empty
            and dead. The classrooms, once the home to my imagination, now feel barren. a space where sharing
            vulnerabilities became a rarity, the pain intensifying when unspoken. Thus, solitude seems the only path
            to
            avoid distributing this pain to others. Whenever I revisit these spaces, my thoughts implode themselves,
            further
            fracturing my already broken heart. making the winds even colder, a professor’s bad criticism, which I
            ignored
            initially, gradually seeped into my subconscious, irreversibly altering my perception. Though he made
            attempts
            at fixing later, though the damage had been done, irreparable in my troubled state.

         <p>Is it even worth it? is it? the inner fight, the buried anger, the silence, the ability to hold your
            emotions
            back, the inability to cry, the long pause of silence between words, this so called wisdom that you
            have, to
            live for the things you never wanted, to sleep with a heavy chest, is this you ever wanted, is this why
            you
            slept at the terrace, staring at night skies and making imaginary constellations, is this what you
            dreamt for
            your whole childhood, is this why you started dreaming in the first place, why’d you wanna forget this
            life,
            this love, this curosity you had, for something that never belonged to you, Is it really you shubham,
            I’m
            talking to?
         </p>
         <p>Am I diving into delusion? Not quite yet. I find myself ensnared within a timeline that was never
            tailored for
            me, or so I would assert. As a teenager, I may have appeared sloppy, not particularly active physically,
            yet my
            mind had already constructed an expansive world within — a world of perfection to me. Undoubtedly,
            delving
            deeper into technology was profoundly captivating, but there existed things beyond that. It was an
            burning
            sensation to converse with strangers traversing the streets, simply uncovering the narratives of others.
            This
            occupied a significant portion of my thoughts concerning my future, once I started living independently.
            but
            somehow due to some circumstances this interest of mine weathered away still somehow fossiled inside,
            probably
            because of how other people taught me to become a self-sustaining guy, which is indeed opposite of my
            true
            nature, which I got to realise real fast. also I’ve seen older people trying to find a meaning out of
            life
            (through pilgrimage etc.) I always wanted to make that effort early in my life while simultaneously
            focusing on
            my work, cause I didn’t wanted to get old and yet stand back at square one. In this restless life there
            are only
            limited balancing points in my life, some of which are the people close to me, this limited nature of
            life, this
            very situations I am in, makes me wonder more about the future, and is the cause of my sleepless nights.
         </p>
         <p>Yet, during this summer while alone, I revisited this cherished childhood aspiration of mine. It was then
            that
            calculated the essence of my true desires — I yearned for a life without confines, an existence beyond
            the
            fetters of experiences, past, or future. I sought to inhabit the infinitude available to me within this
            ceaseless “life,” similar to an endless Pink Floyd riff. A life full of experiences (cause i can’t carry
            anything on my deathbed), escaping the confines of shadows and beyond myself— a life that I had always
            dreamt
            for. will I ever get that, what I’m always talking of? I don’t know.

         <p>“The convergence of two seemingly separate entities blending into a singular entity, yet they remain
            seprated”
            it is a curious aspect of my life. It’s similar to the interplay of yin and yang, where opposing forces
            coexist
            within a single existence. This duality, this paradox, passes through my experiences. Picture a coin
            with two
            distinct sides — yet it’s undeniably one coin. Similarly, in my life, there are contrasting elements
            that run in
            parallel. It’s the complexity of existence encapsulated within this paradox. At times, I’ve witnessed
            the fusion
            of both lightness and darkness, happiness and numbness existing simultaneously within me, a
            contradictory yet
            undeniable truth. I find myself alternating between being the composed, well-organized individual and
            the
            fragmented, vulnerable soul. Is this a trick of my fleeting memory or an inherent characteristic of life
            that
            I’ve sought since childhood? Nevertheless, I yearn for the simplicity reminiscent of those earlier days.
            This
            intricacy is reminiscent of my life’s “Perplexahedron,” a term inspired by the cubic planet concealing
            the
            fourth map of infinity. Much like solving its puzzle, life unfolds when approached with a keen eye for
            detail
            and depth of perception.
         </p>
         <p>Recently, I’ve coined another term — the “Uniform Paradox.” It resonates deeply with my experiences.
            Having
            worn a school uniform for an extended period, I now find myself perplexed by the choices when selecting
            attire.
            What seems effortlessly simple for some becomes a bewildering array of combinations and colors for me.
            In an
            attempt to resolve this complexity, I associate outfits with my identity. For instance, I spent an
            entire winter
            exclusively wearing a black hoodie, even though I had other options. It became a symbol, linked to a
            fictional
            character, “Eliott” or Mr. Robot (A rogue hacker attempting to wash down the rich), representing a facet
            of my
            persona. I did good with it, even though I’m not a hacker myself, but I liked being called mr. robot,
            reminds me
            of Rami Malek, Next time I’ll pick something that reminds of Brian Cox :)

         <p>For a long time, I’ve wanted to watch “Notting Hill” and finally doing so struck a chord with me in
            precisely
            the way I had hoped. Its simplicity had a profound impact on how I perceive certain aspects of life.
            Interestingly, I find myself a personal connection to it, something intangible that perhaps you and I
            couldn’t
            discern with our naked eyes but is evident to me through the chemical reactions in my brain. Usually,
            I’m not
            one to delve into discussions about movies, but this particular film has managed to establish a link
            with me
            through a yet-to-be-explored channel. well not to give you any spoilers but the point of notting hill
            for me,
            lies in the place itself, while notting hill might seem a pleasing architectural to the eyes of many, it
            is one
            of the places that you’d find me in the future.
         </p>
         <p>I’ve stopped drinking tea since a month almost, even though it used to be a significant part of my
            routine.
            It’s a small change, yet a notable one for me. I used to be a drink it a lot — having it right out of
            bed and
            then a few more times during college — but I never quite felt right about it. so having taken this step,
            it is
            quite a change, I feel more refreshed now without anything to have, it has affected my skin positively
            too,
            never saw that coming, huh. apart from that, I can’t stop to wonder about the possiblites of my life,
            well these
            days I like to hide from the big events in my life, not doing anything much, not challenging my faith
            too much,
            scrapping the pieces of happiness from the little moments in my life, but is this what I always lived
            for? the
            answer to this can’t be put into words easily but you can see I’m trying to, I definetely never wanted
            to be a
            rebel, instead of the times I was desperately eager to hack into my school’s computer systems and give
            myself
            some grades of glory, and that never happened :)

         <p>Do you know Lucky Ali? Of course, you do! :) How about something to make you feel nostalgic? Today, as I
            was
            clearing some old stuff from my father’s shop — a Diwali tradition in India, involving cleaning out old
            items
            from houses and shops — I stumbled upon something that instantly caught my eye. In a millisecond, the
            image of
            pyramids and seashells wired in my brain pointed towards “Sunoh,” the album by Lucky Ali. It contained
            all the
            best songs that come to mind when you think of Lucky Ali. There it was — an old cassette covered in fine
            dust
            amidst a pile of other famous artists’ cassettes.
         </p>
         <p>While Lucky Ali resides in our hearts, his musical masterpiece couldn’t stay confined to that dusty bag
            any
            longer. So, I picked it up along with a bunch of other cassettes, cleaned them, and safely stored them
            in a box.
            Rediscovering this artistic gem brings great joy. However, it also prompts reflection on how a lifetime
            of hard
            work, passion, joy, and patience can go unnoticed by many. I realize it’s not mathematically possible
            for
            everyone in the world to know about every individual, especially as we move towards a multiplanetary
            existence.
         </p>
         <p>Isn’t it discomforting to think that people may not know who I am and whether or not I ever walked on the
            grassy plains of this planet? (My fossils won’t be as big and distinctive as a smug T-rex) regardless of
            how
            long or short I live. But you know what? I remember a poem from my English class in school — though the
            details
            escape me. It conveyed that statues weather with the wind, empires disappear with the test of time, and
            the
            rulers eventually die. Yet, poetry/art remains resilient, passed from generation to generation. I
            believe that’s
            what Lucky Ali did, that’s what artists do. They create something indestructible that can never vanish
            with
            time.
         </p>
         <p>Atlast I can say, Even if my work or life goes unnoticed by some, it will at least never die.</p>

         <div class="post-quote">The Happiness Algorithm</div>
         <p>I apologise if my words don’t make any sense to you, it’s me, complicated. How to fix life? It was a
            question
            consistent through my search history some years ago. I really wondered about it, is there a quick
            easy answer
            to that? I was not patient enough to find these answers. But there lies something deeper than
            finding those
            answers, there’s this deep desire in me, to do something and dive in it headfirst, get so deep
            inside that
            even sunlight can’t be traced there. And there lies my weakness to run after a single thing such
            passionately
            that I couldn’t trace my life back, which hurts after all.
         </p>
         <p>Lying in shallow waters is something I can’t do anymore, to avoid thinking about life, to avoid
            challenges,
            to be something you aren’t, to be an observer to your own life, let people drive your life’s wagon,
            romanticise the pain listening to that music, becoming someone I don’t want, I can’t live with. Like
            Elliott
            said, “I can be another fool, or an exception to the rule.” The choice was mine to make. I wondered
            if there
            exists an algorithm for fixing everything, with O(1) time complexity. It turns out I was insane to
            find that
            thing. I feel life is not a mere collection of events, it is the events occurring in the sequence
            which makes
            the life as we live it, much smaller than I can observe.
         </p>
         <p>I know even if my writings are unknown to most, writing taught me to wait for better things in life,
            and to
            feel better for the ones you have today. All my writings have taught me more about myself each time,
            it’s like
            reading a book about yourself, but someone else wrote it. I write my heart out, so I naturally feel
            good about
            what I write. I feel like I was driven by emotions at some point of time in my life, all my
            decisions etc.
            were somehow connected to what I felt and another time I took radical decisions, ignoring what my
            heart
            wanted, I’ll call them “just do it” days. I don’t like the extreme points very much in life, one
            that feels my
            complete life is a dream and another feels my complete life is incomplete code. To say, neither of
            them are
            enjoyable, the perfect fun lies in the secret mix of both these, it’s a sweet spot and I gotta find
            it. Of all
            the things I like in my life I enjoy brotherhood very much, I can say that clearly now (as I’ve
            experienced
            it) it’s the best environment I thrive in. To be surrounded by people of my age/interests, maybe
            it’s a little
            to ask but it’s a paradise for people like me to live in.

         <p>Who am I? If this is another one of life’s fallacies, then I’ll leave this question right now and
            sleep early
            today. But there are some things on my mind I want to talk about; it certainly changes a lot of
            things in my
            life. Easily, I can consider myself an NPC in someone’s game where I am bound to do certain tasks
            every day,
            and some programmer may have set my randomness variable value to zero. Am I a mixed bag of people
            around me,
            controlled by the emotions and the mood of other people around me? Completely out of control. But no
            matter
            how indifferent my words might be, you can feel the truth gazing you like a daunting killer with a
            dull knife
            in his hand.
         </p>
         <p>A few months ago, I encountered someone on the bus ride to their college, a person who always had
            punk music
            playing, seemingly to soothe their inner pain or perhaps replace it with a human touch. He
            masqueraded as
            happy, but with each passing day, a part of him died quietly. He chose to spend most of their time
            outdoors,
            avoiding the life that seemed to cling to them like a dark shadow. silently wishing that this night
            might be
            their last encounter with the Grim Reaper. I found myself at a loss, unsure of how to console this
            person.
            What could bring happiness to this person, and, worse yet, was there any hope of redemption from
            their
            torment?
         </p>
         <p>As it turned out, It was me all along.“In pursuit of one life, he lost another.” The opening lines I
            shared
            at the beginning, potray what he did — he built fences and dug trenches simultaneously, creating
            barriers that
            isolated them from the world. But you know what came next? HE rose up, found himself as the strength
            to
            separate themselves from the darkness which consumed him, unbroken by words and people, He never
            looked back,
            never.

         <div class="post-quote">"Coming Back to Life"</div>
         <p></p>
         <p>“I took a heavenly ride through our silence, I knew the moment had arrived. For killing the past and
            coming back to life.” Man, I’ve gotta say these are the best words I’ve heard in days. It’s like
            entering another dimension of life again, falling endlessly, smiling into this spiral, slowly
            descending, my hands touching the ground first, then my body, and finally, a slow rebound — all this
            while neglecting all the other things in life. Don’t accuse me of being high, I’ve just listened to
            some Pink Floyd. Yeah, truly :)
         </p>
         <p>So it all began some days back. I was getting really tired, and incredibly numb. I was constantly
            going through a lot of self-reflection, I was not comfortable being “me”. Constantly giving
            subsequent interviews and coding rounds, expecting replies to come, compulsively checking my inbox
            for an update, all this while studying a few hours for my exam preparation. I don’t know if this is
            hard work or not. I’d likely say it’s not. There’s a lot more to do and a long way to go. You are
            with me, my friend, aren’t you? So, what did I do? I tuned randomly into “The Division Bell”, “The
            wall” and found some inspiration to draw from, to look into the mirror again and start thinking
            again. tuning to some of these peices, I feel like seeing my childhood as a observer now, hearing
            all those familiar sounds of my childhood, I can see the smaller version of myself, lost in his own
            miniature world, unheard of all the things in this world, trying to make sense of these new humanly
            feeling someone dropped in him, buidling his life like it’s a mini trainset. It’s a trip to my
            childhood, everytime.
         </p>
         <p>I had this notion of “The Weak Society” in my mind. It’s a nerdy idea, but get it. To build a network
            of all those people from the world who don’t have anyone to go on a dance with, who still think
            there are monsters lurking under their beds, who have a 9 PM bedtime, who still cry watching Mufasa
            die, who dread the string of paper cuts — to bring all those together. But do you know the irony?
            You only join this group of people to exit this group. It makes you realize where you are. Even
            named “The Weak Society,” people are not weak, they’re just struggling in their bodies, trying to
            fit in. In the end,

         <div class="post-quote">The Equation Universe</div>
         <p>Hey, I know you missed me these 5 days, but what can I do? I was juggling back and forth between the
            future and the past of my life every day, mentally. Until someone invents the time machine. I had
            this thought today that I wanted to write. It’s a little rough, but you’ll get it, trust me :)
            Sometimes I feel like I see the world as a grand mathematical equation. It’s unusual for me to think
            that way, but hear me out. To convert love to attraction, to convert the future into probability, to
            convert hatred into repulsion, to see failure as a failed experiment. It seems a perfect world to
            me, a sweet world I always wanted. But wait, why? Why convert everything to logic?
         </p>
         <p>“Life hurts, logic doesn’t.” You can always correct your logic and maybe become a better human. It’s
            my way of thinking to avoid getting inflicted by people and life, reducing this mere exsistence to
            binary code. But still, each morning I awaken, I feel like the robot in the parkour game,
            “Vector,”due to some malfunction, wakes from his sleep pod and then runs away being chased by the
            robot boss. Maybe he got awakened to the dystopian world he was living in, I wish to wake up from
            this dystopian world I live in, to be something more than just another brick in the wall.
         </p>
         <p>There always exists something higher than what I can feel in life. If someone were to question me,
            I’ll say, “I am a broken human. born on the assembly line and some computer virus gave me emotions.”
            If you worry about my contemplative nature, don’t fret, I’m still a child at heart and this is my
            wonderland. Whatever I think, I know there exists something much higher and deeper than I can feel
            or possibly know of. Somewhere in my heart, lies that affection for imperfections, tilted lines,
            breezes, highs-lows, fear, joy, anger, that scents of raindrops falling on earth, which don’t exist
            in my binary world, even if they did, they aren’t original. If you ever wish to meet me in my binary
            world.

         <div class="post-quote">Comfortably Numb</div>
         <p> I’m numb or I can say comfortably numb, which I don’t like being these days. “Well the way I feel is
            the way I write, It isn’t like the thought of a man who lies.” I was a arrogant kid sometime before
            life brought me to my knees, it told me many things about life, someday it whispred in a cold way in
            my ear, “nothing remains permanent in life”. It feels like getting hit by a hard sack of bricks onto
            your head. whatever you had, you lose it, even if you have a house a family, all your personal
            belongings get stolen, you feel robbed by life. the toys that you used to fonder are now long gone,
            your warmth for people, it’s not there anymore. all you’re left is with a empty house. nothing feels
            familar, nothing exciting anymore. you feel like an addict to your own persona, having no power to
            change anything.
         </p>
         <p>if you’ve seen death note, you know that the Shinigami deals the eye of shinigami (A power to see
            people’s name and their lifespans), in exchange for half of your lifespan. not suprisingly he made
            deals with humans, who traded half their lifespan multiple times. In reality, sometimes you feel
            like you’ve traded your soul for something not important.
         </p>
         <p>I had enough of this humanly realm :) maybe I should talk about aliens, one of my favourite
            scientists, Neil de grasse tyson, had this crazy thoughts about alien civilisations. it’s our
            imagination that has made aliens offensive truly. it has some evidence, you can see how we humans
            had fought wars for power and dominance which is a common theme throughout the history of ours. we
            imply the same for aliens too.. assering the technological advanced aliens might fight the weaker
            humans. this is what fears human species of aliens, they fear they might see a reflection of
            themselves. but for any alien readers, I welcome you with open arms, whether you’re a klingon, a
            gorn, a friend from another galaxy, you’re welcomed for some chit chat and a friendly game of
            Battlefield 2042.

         <div class="post-quote">Backdoor Glitch</div>
         <p>I always had this backdoor approach to life, to do the same thing but without knocking the obvious
            door. It was fun as a child, As I played “Urban Regin 2” it was running to the wall, the opponent
            follows you, execute wallflip and Peekaboo!! attack him from back. It was helluva fun :’) but as I
            grew I found painful to use backdoors in life and to not live upto what I wanted, I know the obvoius
            backdoors to the pain (Alcohol, smoking, hooking up) but it would only push me one mile away from
            home. I won’t say I didn’t use them, but I believe going the distance.
         </p>
         <p>When I’d see things and time falling apart, I’d always be looking for something else to do. I’d take
            things as granted, assume what happening to me is my fate and in the end of the day, sleep with a
            heavy chest or be more deluded so I can eliminate that too.. Do you know something? Life without
            interest is non existing for me, I can surf through my life, not taking the courage to make right
            what I’ve done wrong, in the end It’ll always feel a void inside me. Suffering is envitable for
            everyone and for me, but I gotta keep the courage to do the right, to do what must’ve been done..

         <div class="post-quote">Last Wishes</div>
         <p>I have started gaining some momentum with time, though it’s my start and it’s a long journey ahead.
            I’ve decided to quit some of my addictions I had, I had left my tea breaks for sometime, disturbing
            my sleep cycle. I am not willing to use instagram for a long time now, I don’t feel quite good after
            chatting with someone for hours and then going to my bed feeling bad. I’ll rather chose to go to bed
            tired after playing a badminton for sometime. personally I feel like adhering to a good bedtime so
            that I don’t feel tired in morning. and I’ve fixed a time for my studies which I keep for just my
            work, not be disturbed.
         </p>
         <p>Hey Reader, I know someday you’ll know what happnened afterall but this is about today, what you read
            is what I feel without any changes in this moment you are me & I am you, I feel particularly good,
            but there’s a little crippling feeling and fear of will I complete what I’ve chosen? It chills my
            spine, but I believe in myself, there’s always a open door for quitting, but that ain’t for me. I
            will make sure, I live upto what I wanted. I’m shy about things in life, yes really. to start
            something new, it means a lot to me, that’s why I never told people, but it’s my joy to have
            something unique to myself.
         </p>
         <p>One thing I always had in my mind was to not make my life extravagant, I just want something quite,
            something intricate, more personal than ever. It’s how I see life, to explore all the grasslands,
            rivers, sunset/sunrises, places, to write about my experiences. getting to know humanity, people,
            the pain in this world, I wanna see everything! if you wanna imagine it, I’d want to live a life
            like Che Guvera. for many people he’s an idol, he lived his life helping people, riding motorcycle
            across all the south america, he rode for days and days just to find his inability to help people,
            which changed him forever. he’s someone I can only dream of becoming, he’s in one of the top spots
            of the “People I wish I met” list.. he always is. I can’t think of a perfect ending for this night,
            so I’ll say the magical word, goodbye.

         <p>“To know the answers I was always searching was tough, but some they were just living here within
            me.” particularly I have a dream and I wanna do something about it, I wanna go the hard ways now but
            not the ones you think which I have already been through, there are only so many things that I like
            doing, and I want to do those, now. living a life by interest rather than compulsion is what I
            always wanted. As a kid I never wanted to be someone, everyone is becoming, I wanted to be cool, the
            one who knows everything. maybe it’s curosity but it is something that really made me feel alive. I
            wanted to go deep into somethings, to be optimistic about future, to be excited about tommorow
            before going to bed & somewhere I lost my motivation, never the dream though. I’ve been at the
            bottom for a long time and I wanna jump out of it. I wanna change things, I just want to do it.
         </p>
         <p>I deleted my social media since two months now and for a good time now, I further continue to reduce
            my distractions (there are many). I want to do it this time for myself, for the life I always
            wanted. I will not sacrifice my happiness, which infact comes from the people I live with, I bet
            they won’t leave me. for the things I lost, “Every thing that you love, you will eventually lose,
            but in the end, love will return in a different form.” says kafka. though I haven’t read his books
            but I want to enjoy reading them someday, slowly, taking time. feeling every word as written and
            take those to my grave.

         <p>Am I just lazy, or does the world seem to be moving too fast? Well, I can’t provide a definitive
            answer, but one thing I can say is that it’s changing, and it’s changing for the better. I haven’t
            been writing in recent days even though I had many thoughts to express. Being an introvert, I tend
            to speak less with words. While searching through various profiles for my internship, I came across
            several personal websites of professors. I was amazed to see how they made their sites both fun and
            meaningful; it truly caught my attention. Some of them had a fondness for superheroes, especially
            Iron Man. This sparked my interest in the research life, exploring how the slow yet substantial
            progress can be so fulfilling. To be honest, I quite enjoyed my time during the research phase of my
            life. It’s the complete package of what you’d expect things to turn out for a person like me, a
            “half-blooded prince.”
         </p>
         <p>some fictional wanderings, Vaas once said, “The world is a diagonal, and I’m the balancing point.” In
            the midst of chaos, holding a flickering candle takes courage, even when you know it might not work
            this time. It takes a determined individual to defy the world and do it. Rocky did just that when he
            fought Drago. He knew for sure that the odds were stacked against him, especially without Apollo in
            his corner. Yet, he still persevered. I can’t think of a more inspirational movie than “Rocky.”
            Watching him rise from the streets of Philly to becoming the best boxer in the world and then
            settling for a normal life again is what makes him a dream for me. He faced tough challenges in life
            but never gave up, and he never stopped being Rocky. I still remember the scene where he gets up,
            drinks some eggs straight out of bed, and then goes for a run. Beware, I’ll copy this routine
            someday for sure. Unlike other heroes I’ve seen, he was a down-to-earth person, had close friends
            like Paulie and Mickey, and lived his life one street at a time. I can’t wait to become like him
            someday. I love you, Rocko!

         <p>I’m riding a wave of emotions stronger than I’ve ever felt. For a stretch, I found myself dodging
            life’s demands, struggling at times to articulate my thoughts — a lifelong challenge. Amidst this
            feeling of being adrift, there’s a refuge — a place where my mom patiently waits, where my sister’s
            laughter echoes, and where my dad marks the moments until I return. Maybe I come across as
            unconventional, yet within my heart, there’s this vast, borderless space where certain people
            reside, dwelling rent-free. Without them, my life feels incomplete. It’s a wide-open expanse, not
            confined by walls but filled with cherished faces. When I close my eyes, their joyous expressions
            flood my senses, infusing meaning into my life and nurturing my happiness.
         </p>
         <p>Lately, I’ve taken up learning the guitar, starting with one of my all-time favorite songs by Landon
            Pigg. I hope to master it entirely one day, just the way I dream of playing it. The sheer pleasure
            of playing this tune is indescribable, and if ever given the chance, I’d jump at the opportunity to
            perform it live.

         <p>When it comes to making decisions in my life, they’ve usually been infused with happiness and
            simplicity, almost seamlessly intertwined — too straightforward for someone as unassuming as myself
            to overlook. Today, on September 5th, it marked Teacher’s Day, a day that holds profound
            significance for me. It turns out, I’m still a devoted learner in the school of an extraordinary
            person I’ve been fortunate to encounter. I feel an overwhelming sense of gratitude for the joy,
            happiness, and fulfillment this individual has brought into my life. Their teachings continue to
            shape me; I remain a constant student, never straying far from their wisdom.
         </p>
         <p>No matter how much I express my thanks, it never seems enough for all that this mentor has given me.
            Whenever I encounter a challenge, their words of wisdom and witty anecdotes come to my rescue,
            guiding me through the turmoil. Their insights always encourage me to slow down, to embrace a more
            peaceful pace of life. They inspire me to hold onto beliefs that resonate deeply within me, to
            prioritize the things I cherish, and to relish each moment without the pressure of competition or
            external forces. It’s a philosophy I strive to embody — a life lived simply and beautifully,
            centered around what truly matters to me.

         <p> Do you know “Nandi,” the carrier of Shiva, which is a sacred cow? I remember a memory of mine
            sitting on a statue of Nandi outside a temple. I guess it was in Kanyakumari. I saw that photo again
            a few years back, and it brought a flash of memories. I was sitting on that statue, completely
            carefree, a happy and fun child, smiling like a clown. I had short hair back then and was just a
            jolly kid. But why do I remember it today? Well, it seems that all the happiness that comes into my
            life takes me back to childhood memories, which were the best times I had.
         </p>
         <p>I remember asking my parents to buy a yellow “Transformer” toy after much whining. I even prayed for
            it in the temple. Little did I know it was going to be broken soon. I had my fair share of
            experiences with dismantling things at my home, even if it didn’t lead to anything useful. I once
            disassembled a pocket radio, and I attached it to a completely unrelated object just to make it look
            cooler. These flashes of my childhood come when I really enjoy something or during moments that
            touch my heart and eyes. Today was somewhat like that. Besides, the reader knows about it. These are
            my little guilty pleasures of life, timeless, which I never talked about.
         </p>
         <p>I saw a video today from Veritasium and was amazed to see the Japanese micromouse bots, which were
            even comparable to a coin! The finishing times for these bots were under 10 seconds for most of
            them. Just like Fast and Furious, this is some seriously attractive stuff! How did they do it? I’m
            still scratching my head about it. How did they fit a computer on that thing? There’s no way I can
            figure this out myself. One possible way is to trim off the components not in use from a regular
            Arduino, like the clock and temp sensors, but wouldn’t that make it unusable? The mystery remains.

         <div class="post-quote">Redeployment</div>
         <p>Life’s taken an intriguing turn lately, heading towards an interesting path! Just a few days ago,
            after several attempts, I finally cracked the code to install Kali myself. They say, “The quieter
            you become, the more you’re able to hear,” and it’s fascinating — it carries that intriguing
            spy-like vibe. It’s like having everything you need at your fingertips, a bit like wandering through
            a vast candy store as a kid.
         </p>
         <p>With my reliable Wi-Fi down, I’ve resorted to immersing myself in downloaded content. “Permanent
            Record” by my pal, Snowden — everyone knows him! Edward Snowden, the master hacker and the exile
            king, needs no introduction. It promises to be an intriguing read, and I’m eager to delve into it
            soon. Lately, I’ve found myself bombarded with Brian Cox’s videos, leading me into a philosophical
            reflection: the choice between a finite, fragile life or an infinite, eternal universe. It’s
            mind-boggling to think that we, essentially atoms formed in a giant death star, are the universe’s
            way of understanding itself. When you ponder it, we’re practically the universe itself.
         </p>
         <p>Today, my buddy Trouser Pandi (Birayani Macha!) asked about my winter plans. Since hibernation wasn’t
            an option, it got me contemplating. Here we are in another February of life, a bit wiser and less
            stressed. This might resonate if you’ve known me from the start. Macha’s a cool and laid-back guy,
            an introvert, which surprised me initially, but it’s true. He’s Sanjay from the 4th dungeon of my
            hostel row in NIT — such a great guy!
         </p>
         <p>John Vincent III just released a new country song, “That’s Just the Way It Is, babe.” Shhh, let’s
            keep it between us. I absolutely love this song; it struck a chord in my heart instantly. I
            definitely want to master it on the guitar. That classic country vibe Vincent always brings — I’m so
            into that. I find myself dreaming of singing this song by a campfire on a dark night, under the
            breathtaking stars, on some distant mountain. Ah, another dream discovered.
         </p>
         <p>Writing this feels right. Lately, spending time with my father while doing our usual tasks brought
            back a nostalgic feeling of the old days. Maybe I was overthinking things before. I genuinely
            cherished those moments with my papa. I understand he’s different, but I’m learning to appreciate
            that more now.
         </p>
         <p>Love you loads, Papa.</p>

         <div class="post-quote">I'm on fire</div>
         <p> Of the very few times I use my phone for writing this blog. This entry must be one of them. I can’t pursue
            music I guess for a some time now.. I can’t hear loud sounds and thuds they say. All these days when I felt
            bad about my health or just my bad feeling about the day. i thought I might be having a rough time again.
            This
            continued for a long time. Waking up feeling tired again, just like I didn’t had slept, covered in sweat. To
            quote Bruce Springsteen, “At night, I wake up with the sheets soaking wet and a frieght train running
            through
            the middle of my head..” I’ve been told those might be some nightmares, but they were never really gone. I
            was
            clueless and tired. Just last few days were about pain and rising again, I was having some severe pain in my
            head and I was getting tired really soon. so I decided to put a end to this thing, so I finally decided to
            consult a doctor for this, last evening I went. “I was having Migraine”, the doctor said, I didn’t believe.
            he
            said it’s Triggered by sharp sounds, excess sunlight, family history. Sometime later it all started to make
            sense to me. I don’t know what should I infere from this, should I live my rest of life on painkillers, it
            does feel better without having those. This was very uncalled for at this time of my life. I wondered that
            why
            does all the people who write diaries or blogs, die. Then I chuckled that the question was wrong ;)
         </p>
         <p>just before all this happened, a few days ago I was actually writing on a blog post which holds a great
            importance in my life, I don't wanna turn mad and stop writing that, just because I have some humanly
            migraine..

         <div class="post-quote">20 seconds of life</div>
         <p>Ahh where do we start? 20 years back, perhaps.. it occurs to me that I never did think of future much in
            college. It was living just one day at a time XD but now when I do, I feel good.. I believe I’ll be fine. I
            know I’ve got some struggles along the way but who doesn’t, and I ain’t going to leave them. now when I do
            care about myself It becomes easy to move on, easy to understand people, just to think about others or
            getting
            out of myself. If I see what I’ll do in some years, I think I’ll go somewhere I always wanted to go, the
            places I dreamt of since 7th grade, maybe live a life I always wanted. I forget sometimes I’m just a regular
            boy, I have some little dreams too, I wanted to move to United Kingdom or london to be specific it was my
            dream since I was a kid, I like the city very much deeply engraved with the british architecture, the big
            ben,
            the london eye, the thames everything exciting in one city alone! I wanted to work there on the things I
            like
            doing. maybe it is silly, but I still do. As I turn 20, I feel more closer to myself, to who I am. I am glad
            that I’ve got such great people around me. I’ll want to live with them more than ever. If a song could
            express
            what I feel it would be this. and someone will remember it more than ever. also I wanna continue “The zero
            days of life” to my 21st birthday too, maybe 22nd and so on it is kinda becoming my baby now.. also the
            spotify number is at 1926 as of now.
         </p>
         <p>PS: just yesterday, somethings made me realise how bad haircuts I went through in college :P now when I see
            those, I can’t stop laughing XD maybe that exploration did result in a stable one for some time atleast..

         <p>This was what life was all about! running in circles.. you know what’s interesting? life is limited so does
            our time.. if you had infinite time to live on this planet your life would be very pity soon.. the running
            time is what makes life beautiful, knowing you only have some months to stay at a beautiful place, some time
            to stay with someone, makes you enjoy life more than ever. life’s nature that it is limited makes you a
            human,
            unlike video games where you can respawn everytime you die, in reality all you got is one shot at life. no
            respawning. this is the same reason you like someone maybe because you’re only going to live a limited time
            with them, and after that there’s nothing to be done. sometimes when you’re pushed back by conditions and
            environments you don’t seek much, as rocky said, “go the distance” maybe someway along the path I forgot
            this.
            I am currently just idol, got nothing to do. no direction this time, maybe I take some time rethink a little
            then do something worthwhile, but not the same things for sure ;)

         <p>Here are some thoughts in my mind today that I want to put down before I kick off my shoes. I’m not sure
            where to begin when it comes to this summer of mine. But one thing I can say for sure is that this summer
            wasn’t extraordinarily exciting, and I didn’t do anything monumental. However, it was undeniably the best
            summer I’ve had so far. I can feel a sense of peace and contentment, two things that have been absent from
            my
            life for a long time.
         </p>
         <p>I lived this summer without any fixed plans. Some days, I went to the office without knowing what to do, but
            I always ended up doing something interesting. I might have read something fascinating or had a fun
            conversation with my colleagues, and I never came back with an empty heart. It’s as if everything in my life
            has come together, and my heart shines brighter than ever.
         </p>
         <p>I’ve always believed that life would be full of bliss someday, but I never really thought about today.
            Reflecting on the good things I’ve done, perhaps I’ve become a good friend to some people I hadn’t met
            before.
            I enjoy this “riding the wagon” phase of my life, and this time, I won’t be looking back. I can feel the
            goodness within myself, and I don’t need to search for it elsewhere. I don’t need to be anywhere else
            because
            life is happening today, right now. As someone once said to me, it’s all about the people and places, and I
            believe they were right.

            myself,
            I focused too much outside not knowing what’s happening inside. my eyes are heavy, I’m tired but I can’t
            sleep. you know what, sometimes it becomes our job to not let our inner self down, maybe I'm saying this
            because I'm down.

         <p>So just yesterday I completed “ghost in the wires” and it feels really nice to read a book after a long gap,
            well I read it online and it was still a thrill to read by, it’s about the life and the adventure of kevin
            mitnick, who by his childhood was very amazed by puzzles and magic. then as he grew he became a pro for
            using
            blue phone, ham radio, frequency generators etc. he hacked into companies just with curosity, no motive of
            making anything out of it, later he did various hacks exploiting zero days and the best part was his social
            engineering hacks where he’d impersonate other people and gained priviliges for him it was a game. every
            “su”,
            “root” or the admin priviliges into servers felt to him like a level up in that. this particular line in the
            book, “Anyone who loves to play chess knows that it’s enough to defeat your opponent, You don’t have to loot
            his kingdom or seize his assets to make it worthwhile.”
         </p>
         <p>He did many things that I could never think and at a young age he became the world’s most wanted hacker, he
            then spent two years of his life on the run from working in LA, Denver, Seattle, changing his idendities, to
            work and in his free time to do the thing we was best at, to hack and then getting caught eventually after
            this long run. he believes that human link is the weakest in any security chain, true that. I get really
            inspired from him and his life, he’s a legend and motivation for many people.
         </p>
         <p>**I don’t know this is a tragedy or something today at 21st July I got to know he’s no more. I was reading
            about him for these months and now that I know he’s no more.

         <p>what happens when you isolate from all the noises by just using a pair of headphones, to create a aura
            inside
            your mind seprated from outside world. you know us humans, we tend to fantasize all the emotions and music
            helps us in acheving that. that applies everywhere I guess wherever you go, if you can mute your internal
            chatter you can enjoy what you’re living, peacefully. no limit, no thoughts, no good no bad.
         </p>
         <p>One thing I feel is to let change come into my life, not resisting it in any way, let places, people,
            thoughts, taste, ideas, smells, sound change you. I think I wrote a postcard line or something funny but it
            is
            true :P A new smell or fragrance does lift my mood just as a filter coffee in evening. I guess karate kid is
            a
            lot of wisdom for a small mind.
         </p>
         <p>also to take my mind off things I have been playing battlefield 4 from past days one day on a count of 5
            hours+ not feeling good wasting time, I guess no playing for next days. “Ghost in the wires” by kevin
            mitnick
            as I mentioned earlier is about to complete, a lot of adrenaline rush from reading a book online this time.
            also this new thing I found on youtube about liquid NNs is something cool..

         <p>Hey ya! haven’t seen ya in a while. do you know I rided in a storm, actually not like a cool sharknado or
            something. but just a normal ride in the rain, well this was also a spontaneous thing to do. just 5 mins
            before we thought this and five mintues later we hit the road. cycling through the rain, stopping at a local
            coffee vendor for a quick charge then back on track, I guess life would be this simple all the time. well
            that
            was 2 days ago. after all these days of coming here, I feel like I should’ve left my home early. that
            would’ve
            great if I’d have done that.
         </p>
         <p>do you feel like you were chasing something in your dream and when you wake you are just lying on your bed,
            far away from the thrill of the chase of getting that thing. that does happens to me too.. just somethings
            you
            chase and when you get there it’s just nothing, empty space. just like an oasis.

         <p>It’s a coincidence that I’ve started writing the same time I did yesterday but many things changed
            yesterday,
            as my roomate and my friends had completed their offline internship, good luck Raunak and Abhijit! kudos to
            you guys if you’re reading this. also to my goofy techy friend, Ashwin, will miss you buddy too.. so to
            start
            things again I just started from the same spot we guys ate for numerous days. It brought a ton of images to
            my
            eyes. so just a clean slate again I guess. I don’t know what passive thing I feel, to never let go of
            people,
            to tell you it’s not the best thing ever. life demands randomness and confidence too. maybe sometimes one of
            these are lost, afterall it’s a question of exploitation vs exploration. what will you choose? Try a mix of
            both! ##th is is the most spoken line on tzdol yet..
         </p>
         <p>fun fact, I just used a fabric whitener, of which I was unknown of the result, supposedly contained bleach,
            ruining my dark grey shirt, that was my favourite shirt but it’s orange now due to bleaching. whatta
            mistake!
            Attaboy :P
         </p>
         <p>Also a new luke korns video is out, here. this time luke travels to live in amazon being inspired by a book,
            and he manages to get into the deep amazon jungle. it’s a very beautiful thing to see. I really admire his
            work, he really inspires me to walk in his shoes. it’s exciting how simple things can be such impactful. I
            love that and if you’re reading till here and my kinda footnote makes you smile, love for you..

         <p>Writing blog started as a hobby, but now it seems there’s a higher purpose to it than just write about the
            interesting things in my life. to share the joy of my life or the beauty I get to see through words. one of
            most interesting things I like doing is “what next?” if you know me from some time, after something
            interesting happens in my life i post “what next” on my social media, well it takes time to do that,
            sometimes
            waiting for months, but still it happens. I enjoy that moment where I don’t know where I’ll be next or what
            the next one will be, but the uncertainity of the moment gives me chills.
         </p>
         <p>Also now I’d like to share this space for someone new in my life, I can’t mention the details but it’s
            beautiful. I didn’t think about sharing my life before, as I was a dumb person those days, but now I am
            going
            to. it’ll be very personal and integral part of my life from now on. maybe this is what makes me feel
            complete, a missing piece of my life’s puzzle or this is my life’s save game moment.

         <p>So this is a quick fix for life or a thought for mind, I don’t know. everytime I see my storage clogged or
            my device living on the last GB of space I wish I had, Free space. free space is intriguing it always
            captures
            my mind whenever I wish for it. let’s say whenever you wanna increase your learning or you wanna do
            something,
            you wish having free mental space. our computers do can get it by just simple Clicks on the GUI but we
            complicated humans have a different method for achieving this. maybe sometimes all we want is some space or
            a
            place to think new things, that is what we call a escape in life i think. am I right or wrong, it’s
            conditional.

         <p>I’m enjoying free coffee these days, but I won’t disclose my source. I take it very seriously. I cycle
            around
            the campus in my free time for fun and to meet new people, with no intentions of getting into a
            relationship.
            Haha…
         </p>
         <p>Also, the zero days have begun, so just the day before yesterday, I started running my simulator. The
            process
            was quite tough, involving tasks such as installing modules/packages, changing paths, and mitigating
            compilation errors. It was fun to mingle a folder of code during these days. Now I’m ready to fully
            understand
            it. I’m currently reading Kevin Mitnick’s “Ghost in the Wires,” and it’s a fun and adventurous read. I’m
            also
            excited about participating in my first hackathon. I’ve never been to one before, so it’s going to be a
            great
            adventure to be a part of it. There’s an online qualifying round for it, so I have to clear it with my team
            before I can proceed to the offline round. Let’s see how far it goes, but you, the reader, will know the
            result in one go. I’m jealous of your perspective.
         </p>
         <p>Sometimes, all you need is a change. Maybe stress takes over or your emotions go haywire. This is a normal
            human behavior, and it’s okay to feel pain, as in the movie “The Fault in Our Stars” where Augustus said,
            “Pain has the right to be felt.” Now when I think about it, it’s absolutely true. My college was starting to
            take a toll on me, and these final days of exams were becoming like hell. I’m not even from an IIT or a big
            college, and I don’t know why it was happening, but it was painful at times. My friends knew what I was
            going
            through during those days. Well, let’s leave the past behind. These days, I’m feeling really good, with a
            good
            routine and lovely evenings. Maybe the essence of life is not to be weighed down. Perhaps we’re meant to
            handle things lightly, to savor the small moments we often overlook, and to appreciate the goodness in our
            lives. Like having the opportunity to talk to a nice person or enjoying the lovely evenings that seem to
            serenade you. That’s life — short and sweet.

         <div class="post-quote">The French City</div>
         <p>So, what’s up? Hit refresh and get going or stay in a sweet dream for a little moment. This weekend was that
            dream for me. It wasn’t instantaneous, actually. We had been longing to go there for quite some time, and
            Puducherry, or “Pondi” as we fondly called it, finally happened. Unfortunately, Ashwin wasn’t able to join
            us
            on our biggest intern trip due to being caught up with work.
         </p>
         <p>So, Raunak Bhaiya, Abhijit, and I packed our bags and headed to the dream we had been dreaming of for two
            weeks. Every day, we talked about the crazy things we’d do there, and it was quite an adventure! The city
            attracts you in every way, with its soothing weather and a vibe that makes your day perfect. The city, once
            occupied by the French, showcases its beauty in architecture and culture. The buildings are vibrant in color
            and an abstract art in their own way. My first encounter with Puducherry was before even entering it, thanks
            to one of my all-time favorite movies, “Life of Pi.” It’s a French craftsmanship, and Piscine Molitor grew
            up
            there. His dad owned a zoo in Puducherry before they decided to move to Canada.
         </p>
         <p>The coastal city is a marvel of love and peace, be it the streets, the people, the food, or the environment
            —
            everything. The whole day was a joyride, we hit the beach, and it turned out to be real fun, with splashing
            and riding the waves. After having fun, I had a very personal moment sitting on the shore, listening to the
            waves and watching the water move back and forth. In that moment, I decided not to settle for less in life.
            It
            wasn’t arrogance but an inner call for me to listen to myself and appreciate the beauty it brought to my
            life.
            To bring peace and happiness from people, places, and winds. Also, just for a bit of fun, I decided to bring
            my girlfriend to Pondicherry before anywhere else. Yes, really. It’s a very personal place indeed, and even
            someone like me felt that. I don’t know what brought it to my life, but I take it seriously now. It’s not so
            much about the show or the photos; it’s about the energy of that place and the mutual happiness one can
            feel.
         </p>
         <p>So, that was in the morning. In the evening, I got to hit the beach again and roamed the streets like a
            tourist. A weird thought came to my mind — to make a video recording my thoughts — and I did just that.
            After
            finishing and taking a few photos of the sunset, I walked along the shoreline. I found a spot to sit, with a
            couple on one side and a man in his mid-20s on the other. I’m a bit of a wanderer, so it made sense for me
            to
            sit there. I glanced at the person on the right, and he did the same. I thought of striking up a
            conversation.
         </p>
         <p>A few moments later, he asked, “Where’re you from?” I replied, “Jodhpur, Rajasthan.” Then, we started
            talking, and I got to know that he was a native of Puducherry. We talked a lot about the city, life, and
            oceans in general. It became a personal conversation, and he shared his life and the colors of it, while I
            shared mine. I was very happy talking to him. After about 30 minutes, he said he had to leave. So, I asked
            his
            name, and he replied, “Rohan.” Before leaving, I said, “We’ve never met before in life, but you feel like a
            big brother to me. I don’t have any.” Then I hugged him, and he left. Maybe this was somewhat what the
            nature
            of life aches for — freedom, happiness, warmth of a personal talk, and silence. It was a very heartwarming
            moment for me. Then I listened to the waves for some time while sitting on the shore, grabbed a coffee, and
            left for the city.

         <p>So the world is round, comes back to where it started. life is a cycle, an alternating cycle, if you can
            believe this, it’s a good thing about life, cause you don’t leave earth on a bad point or a open cause.
            that’s
            the beauty isn’t it? the more you think about it, the more naive you feel about your opinion about life in
            general. every system has some vulnerabilites so does mine, my lack of ability to connect with people or the
            ability to understand their hearts is one such thing. the general code of life is open sourced for some and
            encrypted for other people like me. I’ll like it to be on the former, no questions asked, no locks, no keys.
            just open windows and bliss shining all over. I am very naive, I don’t know about a lot of things in life,
            don’t know much about myself too.. but I feel the intrests to find these things is very much needed daily.
            the
            sensitive nature of life affected by enviourment, people, music, this makes us humans right.
         </p>
         <p>My intern is going on, it’s a sunday, I’m enjoying the work life balance, a routine for daily things, a
            mental place to think, enjoy life a little, the perfect place to grow, think freely, creatively without any
            bounds. I’ve made good friends here they are fun loving as me, different from places, cultures but with the
            same lifes at core. this place teaches me to get out of my shell, do something, stay open to changes. live a
            life worth living, to not consider getting inspired as a bad thing. I don’t feel alone here, I feel young
            again, not bound by anything, making mistakes learning from them, trying new ones. also gonna talk about the
            city, the place and the experience in the next blog, sorry for the boring stuff today, this is life
            nowadays.
            also here’s a tamil song I’m hooked to these days. love you.

         <p>As many days of planning, travelling, trying my kicks this day has came, I’ve came to the campus now and I’m
            a intern officially. I understand It might be easier for some people to do than me, but It has been a real
            steep learning curve for me this time. I am alone, my parents they’ve left, my room is empty. but there lies
            no sadness in this tone, as I’m ready for trying out what I wanted to do all time long, to work my own way,
            to
            make my day the way I want to. it took a train from banglore and a few bus rides exploring the beautiful
            city
            of tiruchirapalli, to get here. I have a new beginning for me this time, starting all over from ground zero
            and I can’t afford to waste it. there are a million thoughts in my mind. I’ll do it, I’ll become the person
            I
            always wanted to be, this is my “Hridayam”.

         <p>“Life is full of stories” I think some people like me forgot the meaning of this sentence. In my childhood I
            liked reading comics at my parental house, that comics didn’t had any logical learning for me, but looking
            at
            the photos, caricatures, goofy cartoons, just made my life fun. It was like diving into a fun river, naked
            or
            playing into mud again. Well that was childhood, I wasn’t any social person, relations meant very personal
            to
            me, like a thing only me and my mom would know. Yeah that’s something about my childhood I realise these
            days,
            as I see children smiling. So that was a emotional talk right? Naah, but a great news is I am starting my
            internship Tommorow, and it’s the time I dive into cybersecurity for sure, this time. Life’s changing and
            I’m
            liking it, in a long time, I feel younger than ever before. I hope life regains the meaning it had some
            years

         <p>“It’s a shining day" and I’m moving to and fro in the train. The weather is a little humid and hot, I played
            EA Sports, “Cricket 07" in my childhood I selected the humid weather, because it increased my chances of
            taking wickets, I didn’t knew this is what it feels in real life XD also the train is packed! I’ll say it
            again. It’s more than I’ve ever seen. Just the last station I was about to miss boarding it back, I went to
            quench my thirst and the train started moving, with no foot space to step on I had to get into 3 coaches
            away
            filled with too much of crowd, else I’d miss my train that time.

         <p>Everything is ready to go and together. I have my bags ready just waiting to move out. Today afternoon, I
            had
            a chance to think about what my future would look like and what combination of events are possible. Above
            all
            I’m ready, I’m ready to face challenges, myself infact, I’ll try to be the best shubham, possible. When I
            come
            back, I must be more lovable, open minded, in a better relationship with myself importantly, becoming a
            person
            people would wanna be around. For what all the things I’ve done, some of that can be fixed and some of which
            couldn’t be. I am hopeful for whatever happens next. I trust my parents, my buddies in college and even you.
            I
            couldn’t put that in words, it’s me. (Now i understand the plot of fast and furious) Thanks everyone, it’s
            because of some annoying guys I’m this person, who knows I’d be a “punk degenerate" for sure XD also I wanna
            buy a skateboard, so open for crowdfunding huh (⁠•⁠‿⁠•⁠)

         <p>“Life changes, for a change”, I might not be a good writer. but yes it does, all my life ever since I was
            born, all my days before college were somehow connected to me in particular, be it anything. my choices, my
            decisions, the games I played, the music I gave my head to, all the things were inclusive to me and I
            thought
            it’s gonna stay for the whole life ahead, I had a idea of what family is obviously, but it was limited. when
            I
            met people who were all different than me, I faced the trouble of getting along with them, there’s no point
            in
            living life alone and without anyone to sit by. so I tried cracking jokes on me, like my silly hairstyle or
            my
            bad sense of humuor R.I.P. XD I stil keep trying on those hairstyle until I find that gentleman look I
            deserve. I still think those were the best things I did in my life, but wait why? well I don’t know exactly.
            but getting out of my own shell and doing something in real life, forgetting about who I am, what I do. is
            the
            shade I needed in that summertime. sharing my joy, pain, anger, numbness with people made me feel alive. but
            I
            still think there’s a lot to do there! right fella?
         </p>
         <p>When I’m free, I keep myself engaged like bing wathching Big Bang Theory or digging soemthing intersting on
            internet, this one’s really a saver for me. A little late writing this time. aah I’m sleepy again. gotta go.

            don’t know what to say now.. but whatever comes in the way is a must watch for me.

         <p>The world is twisted, so am I. I’m saying it .. If humans like you and me who think this much everyday,
            processing so much information, images, sounds and calling our memory every single second, doing what not,
            living portion of our lives in future and past, If we aren’t twisted then who will be? our brain is a
            powerful
            GPU ofc, wish Nvidia made something this powerful in budget, gotta upgrade for GTA VI, but what’s more
            amazing
            is how beautifully we live our twisted lives. there’s nothing we can do to change things instantly, neither
            there’s a rewind nor a forward in our daily lives. telling our stories is a important thing we must do, this
            is what my nutcracked brain learnt. for me it’s cracking a joke, or my affinity for music… well that was a
            heavy talk for a introvert to say right..
         </p>
         <p>Writing today’s blog listening to another masterpeice by The oasis, "don't look back in anger". sometimes I
            have to check twice for
            the link I put here, kya pata kya mil jaye. I really wish to write in long lengths but endsem exams is a
            ride.. also here’s a fun fact, I chose “zero days of life” as my blog name for now cause I thought
            previously
            some other names such as tennyson writes, Shadow of life, life note, but they vanished before this one, I
            thought zero days might be a good name, it inspires me to write something exciting. also a cool one I
            guess..
            I’ll see you in next one.

         <p>"Every Teardrop is a waterfall”, isn’t it a beautiful thing to say.. just yesterday gone uncomfortable for
            me
            in some ways, not a bad day, I still got my lessons to take away. It’s a classic dilemma known to everyone
            that how would your life become if you had everything you wanted, and happned as you wished. not unknown to
            me. maybe I don’t write about these things in my life, I always talk about the happy nerdy cool things but
            still something, a peice of puzzle in me or the base block of my tetris is missing, nevertheless life goes
            on.
            one of coldplay’s great success of their collections is, every teardrop is a waterfall released in 2k11,
            from
            the Mylo Xyloto Album, somehow this song struck my mind today, afternoon, on my way to home. so what was I
            supposed to do, put my headphones on. It relates to me more than ever.

         <div class="post-quote">Romanticising Mars</div>
         <p>So just a few days back I wandered about ideas of colonizing mars, it’s another sci-fi dreams, you wish come
            true someday. just a random idea I’m starting with.. it’s about colonizing mars, don’t say bring GTA 6
            before
            that.. as to dive in some fiction not considering all the things that I say happen in reality, maknig mars
            our
            home is actually a pretty dope process, first thing first bringing humans to the planet requires a proper
            spaceship enough to carry propellent, resouruces, humans with it contratary to popular rockets designs, some
            new ones can be torus based design or Spiral designs, the advantage being it can create and artificial
            gravity
            inside the spaceship like the one in interstellar and these are just the basics, you’ll need to carry some
            offline anime series, mangas, video games, heck of a music download for many years to come, well that’s just
            about going there. you do need a plan to make a dome there, or your place of living isn’t it.. you can go
            for
            football shaped dome designs or maybe a pineapple shaped house with all the people wearing squarepants.
            obviously carrying the food is out of the options, astronuats have been carrying, meals ready to eat (MRE)
            in
            space for a long time which include frozen and powdered foods, easy to digest and carry. but the quest isn’t
            over there are countless number of things to keep in check, that’s for a another day. also this one’s an
            endless quest to talk about, let’s do it again sometime.
         </p>
         <p>also I’ve been ducking all the exam bouncers these days, with things coming fast, tough to catch, I’m
            exploring some other ways to write, well there are so many, my previous blogs have been about things niche
            to
            my thoughts, that’s why a change. so yeah this was it, see you in next one.

         <p>Just saw Luke Corns youtube video again, the video about hithcking across india is a beaut, so begins online
            meeting an indian hitchhiker online and then planning a trip, finally hitchhiking the whole of south india,
            living at strangers, making you love the idea of hitchiking. his channel features some great videos but
            especially this is something, really appreciate the work man, this is the link to the video.
         </p>
         <p>I’m not a hitchiker or a freuquent traveller, but this is a perfect way of living sometime, the video
            especially struck as my stay in south india is coming closer, 19 days to go.. what’s more exciting is
            meeting
            strangers, getting to know about different colors of life, staying far from social idendity, where no one
            knows you, living on your own, where people don’t talk your language. it’s concerning sometimes. but how can
            I
            miss living like this feared by small challenges such tiring train journeys or adopting to a new climate.
            they
            just seem to fade with time. especially I can listen to music all day and never unplug my music XD. well you
            gotta shed your old skin someday, this is my chance of having a change, live on my own, call it bad or good,
            it is what it is, I’m confident that I’ll make it. I gotta valspire’s, “We’re going on a adventure” spotify
            playlist for that. 92 hours of headbanging madness haha..

         <p>“the real slim shady is here”, while scrolling reels found this theme song, “return of the tres” I knew it
            because of the game“total overdose”, it was the theme song of the game. I still remember every details of
            the
            game, Ramiro Cruz is the man, all the missions, such as “The ambush”, “The father”, the rewind button and
            the
            iconic train mission at last, one train, a dirt bike to chase and bullets flying all around.. gotta rescue

         <div class="post-quote">Ion Propulsion</div>
         <p>“daddy’s gonna buy you a mockingbird I’ma give you the world” writing this section listening to mockingbird,
            I haven’t been a fan of rap culture or hip hop either, but this one’s something, don’t know the beats seem
            to
            sync your body functions, just move your head up and down, pretend like you’re a rapper too.. talking about
            music rock was my go to from the previous 3 years be it guns and roses, survivor, imagine dragons or
            coldplay
            or all the punk music. say anything but eminem’s a genius.. I thought once covering the room walls with
            favourite rock album covers or movie covers, but the plan didn’t move further, I gotta have a color printer
            for that buddy! and that was foolish now I think.
         </p>
         <p>let’s talk about ion propulsion jetpacks for a moment, I know, I know it’s a lusty sci fi fantasy, but who
            charges for thinking or fondling the mind right.. but what’s this damn thing, if you’ve seen any of marvel
            or
            black panther movie you know the spacecrafts don’t leave a flame when they fly, the reason they don’t burn
            anything for flight or don’t use any volatile fuel like hydrogen or ATF for that purpose, they used charge
            particles for that purpose, says ions.. well what’s wrong then, I wish there was nothing I can say, but it’s
            a
            cruel world :P the problem being ions are not enough to generate such high amount of thrust to lift me or
            you
            up. they say increase the voltage or propellent it’ll get you some more juice out the jetpack but it still
            ain’t that powerful to be a banger, try some new designs or use a hybrid (burn fuel and hearts at same time
            :P) but as a fan it still is far cry for now. it’s not that it’s a complete fantasy it’s already in use for
            spacecrafts. the jeptpack I flew in San Andreas (RIP ROCKETMAN) used fuel based jetpack instead of a ion
            propulsion. check this banger to know more about ion thrust

         <p> Started studying for the first practical subject, logic system design or LSD, funny isn’t it? not every
            subject is named after a psychotic drug right?? I’m two days from the practical and haven’t opened the
            syllabus yet, I think all the fun can come crashing down if i don’t study now, gotta study bye..
         </p>
         <p>sitting in library on my favourite spot located between the breezes of the air conditoiner and the ceiling
            fan “the perfect position” in the universe for thinking..
         </p>
         <p>the heat wave of afternoon has ended with a small nap, and just like usual I’ve watched some episodes of big
            bang theory again, now it’s time to get working again.. but before I go I leave a secret message for you to
            decrypt, it’s encrypted with ROT-13 Algorithim or Casear cipher as you call it, have luck finding the
            message!
            *I tried writing in Klingon but avoided it finally, It became pretty funny although.

         <p>qnegu inqre vf abg pbzvat gb uryc zr va zl fghqvrf guvf gvzr! </p>
         <p>also a thought popped in my mind and it’s kinda about sports, well it’s not new to me that I’m not good at
            any sport unless you consider call of duty or far cry as ones.. but yeah jokes apart, I am really intersted
            to
            play a sport this summer, the idea of doing something daily that makes you happy and fit at the same time is
            a
            real deal, Gym is one such thing, but I think a sport might be better. well it can introduce you to a more
            welcoming group of people in real life, badminton, cricket, I’m just pondering over the choices yet but I’ll
            find one eventually, pretty excited, yep!
         </p>
         <p> before you sleep, the message can be decrypted if you just replace every letter by the character preeceding
            by 13, Q becomes D, N becomes A, E becomes R and so one, it is shift 13 decryption, it is indeed useful for
            nerdy communication or for hiding your message as I do! now as my eyes get heavy, and I am sitting in
            silence,
            I must sleep before I think of something else.

         <p>I’ve been thinking about recording my thoughts and my progress somewhere, a notebook/journal would’ve done
            the job, but it turned out a blog might be even more interesting.. I hope you won’t get bored reading my
            writings. I just wrote the article for street photography (you can check on my profile), also having watched
            so many episodes of “big bang theory” certainly increases some fun here, the character of sheldon a.k.a. jim
            parson’s is a really intriguing one, probably he’s the reason i’m writing a blog now, I wondered over the
            thought of maybe publishing a newsletter too, but let’s give daily blog writing a try first, I think they
            could’ve made a great book series too..
         </p>
         <p>from the past few days the idea of emulators is tickling me, as the current use is limited to playstation
            games, old nintendo controllers, xbox at max, but now my mind is wandering for more such new usecases maybe
            something more nerdy as I like it. apart from the fun of thinking something new, there’s a daunting
            sensation
            of end semester exams just coming to my face. Buzzinga!
         </p>
         <p>now sitting on my desk, typing lightspeed my wandering thoughts, my eyes validating the correctness, the
            subtle sound of keystrokes, the fun of hitting the space bar after every word it’s just a “in the moment
            thing”.
