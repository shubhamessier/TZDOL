                <p>Woah, what a month this has been I'll try my personal best to encapsulate it. I still remember the first day of this month, when I took a break from the office to meet someone – it was kind of daring of me to do so I had to make some professional lie to make everyone believe it. It turned out to be a good memory of mine, I enjoyed that evening, eating the spaghetti I didn't like very much.</p>
                <p>All my life, I've been riding sinking boats, and I didn't want to ride any more. Even when things went south, I still wanted to keep up with it, trying to save something that wasn't going to stay despite my best efforts. But how would I know? I didn't even have the chance to give my best efforts. I don't know why, but nobody really wants to enjoy life for what it is, for what and how beautiful it can be. It makes sense when you realize that there exist ways to dilute your pain, to dilute your experience. However, the dilution of pain comes at a bigger cost of life, and in the end, it's a tradeoff.</p>
                <p>I also had to leave the sinking boats, as the wise ones say, you have to leave from somewhere to get somewhere. The phrase "leaving isn't easy, so is moving on" resonates with me. For some, it might be, but for me, it is painful. It leaves me with a migraine and chaos all together. I begin to love chaos in my life, or I can say that disorder is my order. My head felt like an exploding time bomb, ready to go off any second… but I managed through it. I managed through the pain, and in the end, it left me wanting to love myself, or support myself in the moments I never did. For all the stupid rules I set for myself, the lack of understanding about my own self is the thing that gets me into troubles and uninvited pain. I accept it I open my arms for all the pain that comes. I will go through it I'll rather be in pain than having my life fucked every day for some sad reason.</p>
                <p>But at this point in my life, I want more challenges, more sleepless nights. I want to come out of it strong and better than ever, not the same Shubham again. I didn't want the constant hurting to continue. I refuse to be someone else's second option for my life.</p>
                <p>If you didn't understand any of this, maybe you shouldn't try to. There's a lot more to my life than this, than any of this. After all this happened, I had an intense week of working on the prototype I've been building. I focused every second of my life on it, pulling late-nighters all weekend. I remember one fine evening of constant hacking and programming I chugged three cups of dark coffee. I was like a workhorse, running every single brain cell to achieve the things at hand. I programmed the entire download page at night and also the entire backend for the prototype alone. I finally did it, thousands of compilation errors and issues later. I finally built something worth showing to people. I wasn't completely alone in all this my colleagues helped me through this process. And in doing so, I stayed in the present. I could feel every click of the mouse, every keystroke on the keyboard — nothing else in life, no pain, no regrets. It was a zen thing for me. That was a really memorable week for my life. I did all this with a ticking time bomb strapped to my head. I worked past deadlines, past regularity, and past comfort. I was in a continuum, unbothered and fast.</p>

                   <p>I couldn't really say much, but the events of life become recurring sometimes, different roads, but same crossroads. I had an office party, a celebration, which became a fun yet memorable experience of my life. I've been living in Jaipur for quite some time now. I've gone to Badi Chaupar thrice, and it holds a lot of bittersweet memories for me. I haven't had time to visit other places much. Anyway, we planned for an evening above the ground, at Jaipur's famous fort, to really end the day with a royal touch. While my colleagues were busy taking pictures, I sat down quietly on a wall fence, tripping over city lights as they shone like distant stars in the twilight of the never-tiring city life. It was a moment of reflection for all the things I've been doing since I came here, and of how I haven't changed at all.</p>
                   <p>I saw someone taking pictures of the city beside me. I saw her taking those shots, and I was in her way, so I gave her some space. Then I controlled myself, but I told her, "You can lower the exposure, the pictures will be even better." She said, I am also learning these days to click these shots", I did some tweaks on her phone, and she liked it. I couldn't resist myself, so I asked her to take pictures of herself. I clicked a few, and she liked them apparently. With just fine adjustments, those portraits looked beautiful. I couldn't believe myself, so I asked a little about her. She told me about the places she has been to and her experience of the city.</p>
                   <p>It was time to go, my colleagues ordered something, so I had to go. But before going, I mumbled that, "I might not like to have your contact, there's a beauty to missing someone." I asked her name before going. It was moments after going that I realized what I couldn't explain to her. I asked my colleague what to do now, and she told me to "run back". And yeah, that's what I did next, I ran back to the same place and said, "Hey, Sandhya, I've figured out the equation of what I wanted to say. I told her about my bad experiences of meeting a person and having to stay in touch with messages back and forth, keeping the relation alive. There's a beauty to leaving things at open ends after all, we all want someone to miss. She really understood and said, "You came back now take some more pictures." I happily did.</p>
                   <p>Then I had to leave I shook hands and left, and that was the evening I was yearning for a long time, something to make me feel alive and back human. I couldn't calculate if I am ever going to meet her I don't really feel sad. I feel some good in me and more contentment of what this day has been. Even if I don't get to meet Sandhya again, but one thing I know for sure  how boring my life feels. I know contentment is found in the fort on the hill. And the evening after that? That's a story for another time.</p>

                    <div class="post-quote">Floating Point</div>
                    <p>I've come to ideate a lot more, use my imagination for creating beautiful things and designs. It's a beautiful process. I like the working and mechanism of startups in general, they are indeed a really reactive place. Fun to work at least, sometimes.</p>
                    <p>Sometimes the instance of sharing my life with someone is frightening and beautiful simultaneously, but I don't really agree on the idea of giving myself all out having nothing but dreams of someone. Maybe I am too young to think that. Sometimes these are the reasons why happiness eludes me. I hate that I grow really specific and this doesn't work out well with everyone. The really perfect imagery of "the one" in my mind makes me sad of what's not possible anymore in this world, maybe I've grown in the wrong direction, watered by the fantasies and the utmost perfect dreams.</p>
                    <p>I like dancing, but I don't really like going to clubs, that's not really my type I quickly understood. If burning a pile of cash at midnight (I've got better ideas for doing that) is all to be cool I am an outtie here. I am not against it, well I do want to hang out in clubs sometimes pretending to be Patrick Bateman from American Psycho myself, I can't really do it now, I am not that guy. I actually made a list of the movie scenes I wanna recreate, obviously the bookshop scene from Notting Hill is one of them, also the Social Network dorm room hacking scene and a lot of nerdy fan moments.</p>
                    <p>Oh and also I've outgrown my instant coffee kicks, thanks to my office friends. I don't really use coffee as my fuel 5 times a day. My days have been filled with challenges and learning curves, but thanks to my parents for making me strong enough to go through every problem in my life. Also some secret friends from office I can't really take names of for helping me out and making my little world a better place.</p>

                    <p>I as a human have realised that how hard I avoid this fact, I’m aware of what my vulnerabilities are. They change me as a person. The things I hate about myself are the ones who make me want to walk that extra mile in life, the ones who don’t let me sleep.</p>

                    <div class="post-quote">Coffee-Overflow</div>
                    <p>Apologies for the late update. Here’s something I wrote today on Notepad during lunchtime in the office.</p>
                    <p>Being one with nature is a different concept that actually makes me feel more alive. But there’s another kind of “oneness” that makes life hell. See this example from my life: I told myself some days ago, “My API doesn’t work, my life is Hell!”</p>
                    <p>My life might be hell, but it’s not because of this API problem. It’s just a mask for my deeper internal issues. I realized that these daily problems are just a wrapper for my own personal internal struggles. Solving these won’t have much of an effect on how I perceive the personal hell of my life. Sometimes I have to just move on, keeping my head down. There’s no other path to redemption other than facing the pain I’ve been through, not just any pain, but the one that makes me feel alive, the one that gives my life meaning, the one that lets me sleep in silence, the one that I don’t regret having.</p>
                    <p>I might be wrong on thousands of endpoints in life, but I might be right here. True oneness will come from facing my fears, the pain without any escape, having that “bare” conversation with life, wiping off that slate clean, once and for all. This is the only true liberation. My decisions and choices are heavily influenced by the way I feel about myself. If self-hate grows at this rate, I might not achieve anything worthwhile in life. It’s simple math if I can’t love myself, no one else will. Self-love is not just a hoax; it’s a real thing now.</p>

                    <p>Sundays never felt like this one before. While I wanted to fix my life since the beginning of this year, I overlooked the emotional aspect of it, which now I’m beginning to see lucidly. There’s a certain beauty to people and things which also get overlooked in a similar manner. I believe now flowers aren’t just pretty, they are living embodiment of life and they are more than just an earthly thing. Something things of beauty hold a very special relation to me, and they just stay close to my heart. While you might not be able to decipher everything I’m saying, I believe someone just found my decryption key.</p>

                    <p>“It finally feels like a save game moment…”</p>
                    <p>Back during summer in my fifth or sixth grade year, I was hooked on playing games on my computer. One thing I noticed was that most games, like GTA and Total Overdose, they had this floppy disk hovering at certain points, indicating the save game location. This was where I could save all my hard-earned progress from completing missions. But wait.. why am I telling you this? Yesterday was one of those save game moments for me, and the location was Jaipur, Rajasthan. It started a few weeks ago with an online interview at a startup that went well. This week, I went there for an in-person interview, which was different because most of my previous interviews, except for the Air Force one, were conducted online. I was a little nervous about how it would turn out.</p>
                  <p>The night before the interview, I couldn’t sleep much, not out of fear, but because my mind wouldn’t stop even though my body desperately wanted to rest. It kept running through different scenarios, most of them untrue. Short on sleep, I had to wake up early to catch the train. It was a pleasant ride with beautiful salt fields, especially the red ones. To keep my spirits high, I played some Coldplay music. After arriving, I took the metro and walked 4 km to the interview location. I was sweating profusely but I made it. I grabbed a random book, opened a page, and started reading until I was called in. The interview lasted about 45 minutes. I remember looking at the whiteboard and thought of using it, so I presented a system I had designed recently. I know I could have presented a better design if I had gotten better REM sleep. The interview shifted towards philosophical questions, which provided me with a better platform to express myself and my thoughts. I felt more articulate. After the interview, I waited outside while reading a book about death that was on the table. I dove headfirst into some thoughts until I was called back into the room an hour later. They informed me that I had gotten the job! in an official way.</p>
                 <p>I had to call Ritik and tell him the news. Then, I went to a local cafe and ordered some maggi to eat, as I hadn’t had much breakfast. I called Ritik, telling him every detail. Finally, I caught a breath. The weather was pleasant, overcast and cool or should I say it was “my kinda weather”. I sat there quietly for a while, simply feeling the cool breeze on my face, finally relaxing. I was happy. Next, I met Nandini as we had planned after the interview. I took the metro to meet her area and then spent hours talking, walking around the area, visiting parks and cafes, and finally going for some Udupi food & Filter coffee, I remember the bell they had put up on every table to call someone for the order or the bill it caught my attention and it was a polite way of summoning someone for a work, I found it a great place to go around. then finally saying goodbye to her. Now the next thing was to come back home, I was slightly tired, but I didn’t want to stop exploring, so I continued to discover other areas before catching a late train. I waited for hours at the station, taking trips to different platforms, my legs aching from all the walking. Finally, I dozed off on the train.</p>
                 <p>Yes, this was the day, “the save game moment”, that I will share with others. But you, my friend, already know about it before I even tell you. you know all my secrets and the tricks I keep up my sleeves. Sometimes I see there’s something more to my life’s struggles and problems which I can’t completely decipher today, but we’ll see it together, right?</p>

                  <div class="post-quote">"Alive"</div>
                  <p>There are some things on my mind that I've been holding in these days, and I must write them now. Well, firstly, I've slowed down in my search for good projects. Is it a lack of motivation? I don't know clearly, but possibly yes, or it might be due to a lack of positive responses that I think I should've gotten by now. But whatever it may be, I must keep going until I land something I want, which is to say, a good role in a company I want to work with.</p>
                  <p>My cold emails these days are sparse in numbers, but I want to ramp them up again this time, rise like I always do, even better than last time. All these days and experiences have made me understand the importance of getting challenged in life. I would love to get my butt kicked by time, the sooner the better, before I stagnate or end up on the wrong path. At this point in my life, I don't want to get comfortable at home or at work. I want to come home every day eager to learn new things. I don't seek stability; I crave growth. All the quotes I've heard tell me it's uncomfortable, and I do want that in my life.</p>
                  <p>I don't want to come home every day with nothing meaningful to do or succumb to the slow, tempting comfort of a bedroom. I want meaning in my life, and I'm going to strive for that for myself, not to fulfill someone else's dreams. Obviously, I'm not blinded by ambition to overlook the importance of the people in my life, nor do I want to give up the simplicity of life I have now. The idea of working on something at a desk for hours seems more satisfying than aimlessly sacrificing my sleep and well-being for others who don't truly value me.</p>
                  <p>I really want to hit the gym again. But this time, I want to be full of energy every day, preserving some for the gym. No beating around the bush, I like feeling exhausted, giving it my all every day. That makes me feel more alive, kind of weird, isn't it? I loved that feeling of watching montages from Rocky & Creed and going for the next round. Last time I made some mistakes working out, like not having enough energy or not eating properly. I realize that no matter how many small mistakes I identify and fix in myself, there's always room for improvement. It's the will and the fire that truly take you far.  Also, it feels like "home is where I am." Wherever I go, I carry the good and the bittersweet experiences with me. Sometimes, contentment is all I need, and when I have it, my geographical location doesn't matter much to me.</p>

Now, I'll just start out somewhere in between and try to cover both the ending & starting points" I'm in the midst of a crowd of thousands in a big bustling mall in New Delhi and I'm mentally thinking about mentioning this experience in my blog, yeah I was currently 2 days ahead of myself thinking about this very moment when I'll mention about what happened.</p>
                  <p>Through some family work I got to go to Delhi for one day. As usual my response was "Hell Yeah!" not looking forward for the work but for a chance to be myself again, wander some unknown streets, meet some new people, get out of the small box I live in (not my home). It took a 10-hour train journey to get there, and some sleep cut short. But it was worth it, as the morning began, I walked down the streets of New Delhi, carefully looking for my phone, as it has been seen people are fond of using other's phones more often there. I would've lost my only camera that day :)</p>
                  <p>I wandered streets following arbitrary turns my mind commanded me to take. I walked for a couple of hours before coming back to where I was staying. It got decided to go to a Select city which was in a close vicinity next. Forward to some time later I was standing in this crowd of thousands of people I never met, all different to me, all separated from me by huge gaps of culture and lifestyle. I saw people, different people. I come from a small, not-so-populous city of Jodhpur, also not as developed as metro cities in some ways, but what I saw the most was a cultural shift there. I shouldn't be going to describe the semantics here.</p>
                  <p>I don't know how I exactly felt that moment or what the correct word for that is, but I didn't seem to blend into that crowd. I felt everything at once in that moment: This pressure of life I am not able to handle, this box living I'm not made for. I heard the world calling me, the life I always wanted, the work I always wanted, the happiness I always wanted, and yet I saw myself bound by the chains of luck, failure, and misery which I couldn't seem to break. After that moment, I felt a sudden relief through my body. That moment was a realization. It was more than just a mere part of time; it came to me and I soaked it in myself.</p>
                  <p>Then I continued seeing some other places visiting here and there and then finally taking a metro back to the station. What I think is that people there travel a lot in metro, this being their easiest commute possible. They spend a significant amount of time traveling in it only to realize that a good amount of time has passed by. "Thus life moves fast in a tube."</p>
                  <p>I was happy that I got to experience this in my life. Delhi became more than a city for me. I really enjoyed the rest of my time there. In fact, I would plan to go there again soon. I loved the city.</p>
                  <p>I didn't take any rest, but I had to go to Pokhran the same day I returned from Delhi. Well, it was a marriage after all. Unlike the traditional city marriages, I found it actually intelligent who marry in smaller cities/towns. It's a small and tightly knit bond what they have, not much of a show for people to watch but definitely worth going to. The main highlight which I enjoyed was the clear weather or I say pollution-free skies, that striked like a thunderbolt inside my mind to capture what? Stars. Yeah, I wouldn't lie, but this was one of the most beautiful night skies I've captured yet. It's just beautiful. I still couldn't believe capturing cosmic giants other than the stars and moon; this time I got to capture even Nebulas! It initially skipped my eyes too, until someone made me notice. I just couldn't take my eyes off the sight. Aaah, it's a great feeling. If you wanna see, make sure your brightness is higher and zoom in on the colorful pixels which you can see. Here are the shots. This was unreal.</p>

                  <p>"Oh I am young again, this was all a day dream, as cold tears streamed down my face I said, thanks for waking me up" I wished this was true. but it isn't true right? There will be no day dream that ends and wakes me as a different person a person far away from pain and despair, woken into an alternate reality where I am the protagonist of my own life. The more I think about this whole day dreaming thing, the more I wished It was true, but I had to move on, I had to really "wake up". I have this ache in my soul to touch that blurry infinite thing.. that infinite echo of terminal I could never see the end of...</p>
                  <p>Well this was just the internal chatter talk going inside my mind when I'm alone. but there isn't any stopping to what I create with the free compute resources of my own cloud head, this whole idea of pre-colonisation era of humanity excites me everything from the daily lifestyle, the society, the peasants, the kings how would've they lived? Sadly there isn't a way to get back in time and experience that all.. but if we all do live in a computer simulation there must be some existing cheatcodes to these lives which are human players haven't found yet.. Oh how classic foolishery that would be.. well someone must say we are not as evolved as we think we are...</p>
                  <p>But wait if there's a matrix or simulation then there must be some lag in between the events of this life, how miniscule that might be, it must be there.. is that the difference it takes between a person considered as 1 or 0? if so isn't life so short as comparable to a network lag between two states, all the emotions, memories we hold just disappear into thin air. it is frightening and calming at the same time, why you ask? I'd say it is what it is.</p>

                  <p>I have my GATE exam tomorrow, and to be honest, I haven't prepared well. I did cover a few subjects from the course last year, but that came to a halt when my results were announced. I have to start a sound preparation for next year's exam from this month only to get a good score. I believe in myself that I'll do well, once and for all. I have to consider other career options after college. I should be researching that now, and I'll do it soon. Go abroad? That does seem exhilarating to me. "Leave everything at midnight and go to some country that I love and that doesn't know me, that was always the plan" (just joking, no real plans like this). If I have to do this, I won't leave anything in between before moving to the next part of life.</p>
                  <p>I don't have the classic dilemma for the subject choices I want to go for; that has always been a constant variable. "Constant-variable" isn't that a bit fishy sounding? Also, I am working on getting an internship again. Well, this is the same process as last year, but this time my character seems to have gotten some charismatic upgrades. This time it will be a little tougher process than last year as I seem to have some constraints (financial+academic), but I ain't giving up on anything. I am headed in a good direction for now. I'm trying to be a better man.</p>
                  <p>For what I'm hearing these days This one has gotten me to love music once again in a bustling life, being the center point of my thoughts and my good mood. It just steals a piece straight out of my heart. There's a good chance you'll find me humming this these days, I also want to go for ice skating too, straight up inspired by Rocky, but yeah, it does seem a geographical satire considering my current location. Don't know, it seems to me different than adventure sports, but why? The answer to which my buggered heart doesn't know.</p>
                  <p>*A sneak peek into my mind* "What is it really that lets me sleep well? Or more precisely, what is it about life that calms me?" Believe it or not, but questioning life has become a new hobby of mine. Not that I question everyone on the street, but now I do challenge my faith that I've held for a long time, like the simple trust bonds I have with different people, also the default settings my relationship with other people is. Is it good or bad to challenge my faith? I don't know the answer, but I do seem to notice that the more I challenge my faith or opinions about something, the stronger it gets. There's an initial friction to this thought, but bypassing it is rewarding. I do seem to notice that not changing anything and just letting things come in my way isn't satisfying as well. The small differences I make to my life make a huge difference to thoughts and the way I see myself.</p>
                  <p>Also I fear of being adapting to the easyness of life which is a red pill blue pill situation again, either I wake up to the reality or I sleep and think it was all just daydreams, the things that other people say so casually sometimes touches me deep within, it scares me to be ordinary to be someone who is a perfect fit by this society, this fear of this constant bondage that this society implies on me & my free running thoughts constantly, I hate to say it but I feel like I'm the Julius Caesar of this dystopian world. maybe I think too much, or did I take the blue pill last night after dinner?</p>

                  <p>I'd prefer the former option. I had my interview for my internship yesterday, and it just didn't go as planned. I can say that the reason is me. I didn't prepare well this time. I learned SQL a few days earlier, but it didn't work out, as I hadn't covered the advanced sections, which were probably the important ones I missed. I blanked out during the interview, and halfway through, I knew the result already. I felt shame in a part where I wanted to leave it, but that was not an option for me. I could see many ways where I went wrong. It was one of the first interviews I had that went this terribly.  </p>
                  <p> I felt low after giving it, and the reason was clear as hell. I just didn't feel like discussing it with anyone after that. I felt collapsing inward. But I am writing this to remember the next time I go for bigger things in my life. It will be a remembrance that it wasn't all rainbows and sunshine I went through. I don't want to forget yesterday for what it was. It wasn't my inability to answer some questions I didn't know, it was me who was unable. In this light-speed life, the rush in my heart to skip things seems a perfect option, but I know it isn't the way I'm meant to go. I'd never be a failure if someone else said so. It'll probably be me who has given up on his dreams and ambitions for something smaller, shallower, which he never wanted. I must go through this for what may seem a tough time to others and partly to me but is actually a path to realisation for me.</p>
                  <p>If life ever gets all sorted out or good, I would remember that it wasn't easy, even though I cried my tears never fell in shallow waters.</p>

                  <p>“Yeah it was Battlefield I, which came to my mind at the end.”</p>
                  <p>This is a story about someone close to me who challenged my thinking about life in many ways and even changed it, she goes by the name Anna Scott (changed it). although she seems to have come from notting hill, she indeed is one from sense and sensibility for me. Although I haven’t met her in real life, I can feel her presence within my mind and thoughts. I met Anna in an online community, which I joined because it seemed interesting. She had a unique perspective on life that set her apart. I was genuinely impressed by her intelligence, which was evident from the very start. For the first few months, I didn’t even know her full name, which was a reflection of my foolishness. It took me a challenging 10-day game to know her full name, and that’s when I realized how patient and fun she could be, two qualities rarely found together. I admired her for that. Before all this I had hit a rough patch in my life, where my trust and belief in love was over and I became a free bird, not waiting for anyone to come and help me.</p>
                  <p>Over time, I gradually got to know her better. I would ask about her day, her college life, her interests, and her life journey so far. She was an intriguing person, and we shared some common interests, especially our determination towards each other. Talking to her gave me a sense of excitement and longing that I hadn’t felt in a long time. It wasn’t my fault she truly was an impressive individual. I was falling for her, one day at a time, and affection was growing in my heart, a feeling I cherished. After all, she was smart, and I never doubted her. I never knew much internet slangs before I started talking to her, but she taught me many, some I use till this day, like “Kyool”.</p>
                  <p>She was not only intelligent but also, I believed, beautiful, although I had never seen her face at that time. We spent months talking to each other every day at the same time, and this routine continued. I even got to know her name and added her on my instagram. When I felt like I was becoming a “lovebug,” I gathered the courage to tell her about my feelings in January. It was an online scribble match one evening when I shared that I had started to develop feelings for her. However, my dreams didn’t unfold as planned. I first scribbled some characters, and we played for a while then and I wrote, “I have developed strong feelings for you and I never saw you..” well she was out of words to say.</p>
                  <p>She pointed out that it would be difficult for us to be together and that there was no possibility of a deeper connection. I understood her perspective. Unlike other girls, she was always kind to me. I think She knew I wasn’t ready for a relationship, and that I had many things to figure out in my life. She was right, and I appreciated her honesty. She was becoming the girl of my morning dreams, someone I would be fortunate to have in my life.</p>
                  <p>At some point, my feelings for her grew intense, and I found myself taking photos of coconut trees whenever I saw them. They reminded me of the coconut plantations in South India, where she was from. Anna seemed a bit concerned that my feelings were getting too strong, while I worried about whether I was causing her discomfort. We decided to stop talking for a while, but I couldn’t get her off my mind. I couldn’t find a replacement for her, as I did with other things in life. I had many friends to keep me company, but none were quite like her. I missed her sense of humor and our daily conversations, even though I had never seen her face. I still have a few photos of her that she shared with me, which was a small consolation.</p>
                  <p>One day, I confided in a friend about my strong desire to see her face and hear her voice. She suggested I should just ask her, so I did. Unfortunately, she politely declined my request. In my free time, I would search the internet to learn more about her city, its culture, and the beaches, but it didn’t quell my longing for her. February 23 was a significant month in our story, and I knew I had to meet her somehow. I applied for many internships in her state that were similar and in line with my profile, for all the institutes I knew, and one morning while walking to the bus for my college, I checked my email and received an acceptance offer from her city. I was thrilled at the prospect of going there, but what happened next would alter the course of my life.</p>
                  <p>I asked about this situation with Anna and told her about my plans of her city and staying with her, while I promised her before that I’d meet her someday, in her city. I had other good internship offers, but I chose her city because I was getting impatient to meet her. After talking with her, though, I realized I might be making a mistake by sacrificing a good career opportunity. So, after some contemplation, I shifted my decision. My new destination became Trichy (Still close to her), a decision that turned out to be one of the best I had made in years. However, I was determined to meet her in her city at least once during my time there, and she agreed to meet me once, so it was a happy time for me. I was happy with travelling thousands of kilometers just to see her once for one evening. I actually wanted to suprise her by showing up at her college without informing her, that was the plan atleast, but I saw some flaws in this one as this would give her more shock than excitement, so this one got discarded.</p>
                  <p>After spending a few days in Trichy, I decided to discuss the possibility of meeting Anna with her. I had my tickets ready and inquired if we could finally arrange a time for us to meet. However, due to personal reasons, she declined and suggested that I come after a festival. I agreed, remaining patient. But as my days in Trichy were drawing to a close and I asked once more, she refused to meet me, this time, for good. I vividly recall that morning, it left me feeling deeply disheartened. Internally, I felt fragemented. I took a day off from work and stayed in my room alone, avoiding the office that day. I was angry with myself. It built up in my head.</p>  
                  <p>I couldn’t quite comprehend why she made that decision. I knew for sure she didn’t intend to hurt me, but somehow, it had happened. This experience made me realize how intricate life can be and even her smallest of decisions profoundly impact my life.</p>  
                  <p>Overall, I believed it was over. We continued texting regularly for a few more days, but then in August, I informed her that I was going to deactivate my Instagram account. Subsequently, I chose to sever the connection between us, leaving our story incomplete. I began to doubt whether I could ever carve a place in her heart, even though I had hoped to do so. She had become a significant part of my dreams and letting go proved to be a challenging task. For months of her absence, it felt like a void feeling, something that’ll come when you lose someone close to you, There was no doubt she was close to my heart. I thought of sharing this feeling of missing Anna with my friends, but these constant thoughts of Anna would make them think that I’d gone insane, so I kept these to myself. Fast forward to today, this has become one of the events in my past life, something I can never respawn myself to relive again. If there’s any regret in me it’s getting more of that feeling of my heart pounding, that adrenaline racing in my veins, and that feeling of reaching an oasis in my mind after a long string of never-ending sunny days.</p>  
                  <p>After all this I tried being with other people for a while, but it never worked out, because of what, you ask? it was me probably, I couldn’t be that person I was with anna, never that same shubham again, that feeling never kicked back in my blood again, that feeling aah! just the memories of spending imagining about that evening that never happened, were more pleasent sometimes than being with another stranger (I understand it’s not fair to live this way). I stopped trying, to pretend someone I can be, I just didn’t try, left it completely. while my words might sound more poetic than practical. but lemme tell you I thought the same when I read something like this, being on the other side now, I feel it deeply, far beyond the small limits of practicality. While I am writing and recalling all this, many bitter-sweet feelings race through my mind, but there’s some future to this which I can’t predict now, but it is for time to tell. I owe anna this story, for all her kindness and friendship that meant so much to me when I needed her the most, I cannot forget that. As I write this she must be 22, Though I remember her birthday this January, this whole aftermath just goes in my mind and I couldn’t wish her.
                    I am a changed man now, I don’t ever rest now, there’s no home for my thoughts and my body, I love this this life of a wanderer, without having a “point B” in my life, to sit at every bench in life I want and start walking again, with no desire to reach any end, just to see life as endlessly as I can, to never stop for anyone or anything that I don’t want. a ordinary life doesn’t intersts me anymore, after all this I fear of being ordinary in this world, I fear of falling for someone like anna and I don’t want to settle now, never.</p>  
                  <p>And that’s my story “A lost boy who loved a stranger more than ever, in doing so he found himself a new feeling he never knew he had”. Things get mixed up with time and you’ll probably hear other versions, “A mad boy who went way far away, then made a fool of himself”. But what you heard from me is the truth, I wouldn’t tell you if it wasn’t, would I?</p>

                  <p>The thing about the moon and city lights is that they create a particularly large glare in my night shots (a good 1/3 portion of it). I am intrigued about how I can counter this phenomenon — there must be some way, at least that professionals use, and something specific for my use case. Well, all I can say for now is that it adds a good effect to this particular shot (apparently). You can see all of them here. I’ve tried listening to music while I click these photos at night, and it lifts up the complete experience of capturing stars at night. Oh and if you didn’t zoom in on the images i shared, you missed some important details, besides the regularly shining pole stars there are some dwarf ones you can only see when you zoom in on them.</p>
                  <p>So, an interview is coming up again next week, this time for a data analytics role, and I am not nervous about it this time. I’ll prepare as a soldier, sneaky and sharp for all the traps coming my way. Now, from today onwards I’ll be preparing for the technical interview with a changed approach. Usually, I start from scratch for every problem or interview chance I have, but this time I’ll build on top of the things I already know. One thing I always missed is the question I am given at the end of the call to ask. But this time (I knew it), and I asked about the team in detail I’ll be working with and what we’ll be building eventually, this has given me some pointers for what to focus specifically and foremost to other things. So, got a headstart now. I have contributed to some open source projects before, but working on high-level markup or JS has never interested me. What I eventually want to do is contribute to operating systems like Ubuntu. I understand that it takes experience to contribute to such low-level programs, but seeing my name in the contributors list of open-source operating systems such as Ubuntu or Kali is a dream of mine.</p>
                  <p>One particular thought I have, which should not be led by open source — but it’s my blog, and I’ll do it is that I see pain and sadness as two different things now. Of course, they are two different words, but somehow their coexistence exists in our lives. Pain actually breeds solutions, I’d say. In my life, countering it requires doing something every time. Putting effort into something I love relieves my pain, and doing that sometimes requires a spark within. In short, pain is useful as it pushes me to do something I haven’t done, to push my boundaries, or to simply blow my thinking cap once again! I’ve had my fair share of pain in different forms, sometimes physical, sometimes inner. It’s not the best thing I’d want in my life; it hurts me, causes sleepless nights, takes away the comfort of those daily moments and things I enjoy. It breaks me, makes me think about life harder again, that it’s not over yet and I’m not done. I respect pain now for what it is and for what it pushes me to do. I am not at peace with pain, and I’ll never be it hurts me, and it makes me feel alive again, in the end, “pain has the right to be felt.”</p>

                  <p>“chachu yeh dekho itne sare pakshi” (look at there are so many birds at once) he said, it reminded of how simple happiness for him is, seeing so many birds freely flying at once, he danced in his own way. this evening while I was walking him to a local temple, as he’s used to going daily there. he told me that he has a friend who lives across the street and she changed school before studying in the same class with him, he seemed a bit down by this, though he doesn’t remember in his daily life it is still a memory of him, a profound one. I am at my mother’s home currently, it’s outside of the city far away from the thin air of light speed life. he’s my brother but still he says me “chachu” because I’m his only big brother and everyone else is a chachu, so he’s not bothered by saying me chachu. happiness for him isn’t a complex entity it’s just the things he doesn’t expects from anyone else, he seems to make some for himself. when I see him it reminds of how life changes over year, for once I was of his age, asking these questions, and how many years have passed by, I always thought that life is endless and my imaginations would always run wild without any bounds, but growing up has instilled this time factor into me, that constanly reminds of my mortal nature and the things i have been losing since, i have decided, not to let time take control over my life or letting things happen as they happen, I don’t want to be another person in this “one size fits all” and look at myself unmotivated and sad. I had a messed up childhood, not particularly bad in any way, but I was a big mess in my past and there were only a few balancing points in my life which I don’t want to lose. even messed up I never gave up on anything and I continue not to.</p>

                  <p>It’s not much late but my eyes are heavy already, I haven’t wrote about my life these days, but it’s time. I wrote something, few days prior to today, I wrote a blog entry I had to delete, don’t know if someone read that but it was something I’ve been feeling from a while now, so I wrote to take it off my mind and it did help a little, I was angry about some events of the past and it took a toll on my mind, I don’t speak about openly, but hey this is my blog and I’m allowed to speak here, the thing is I find it hard to follow social conventions, it applies to a large range of them, starting from personal things, I didn’t struggle with this in my chilhood as I accepted everything with closed eyes, it’s not comforting to challenge everything you see, it makes you seem like a social outcast.</p>
                  <p>Acutally what I think personally is to do lesser things this year, hear me out, doing more things != Completing all the things, also more things crowd my mind, means I have lesser free time to include some new changes and also not completing the things I initially set out is a kind of upsetting thing as well.</p>
                  <p>I noticed one particular thing about me that I lack taking initiative in real life, sometimes it’s always a push or seeing someone do things makes me want to do them to, this is not a good thing I guess, let’s say I want to learn, “X” I usually do it only when I see someone learning “X”, and then as a part of the reaction I have to account for the lost time and the learning curve when I am learning. inshort, I need to build my own roads now before I see other walking on their own, Have you heard about building walls? not the actual physical ones or the firewalls, I’m talkin mental barriers, the things I build inside my head to protect myself or kinda my rain catcher, isn’t that cool? but doing so always makes me feel vulnerable or it points out i have some gaping holes in my mental system. that’s why It becomes hectic/painful to set boundaries is indeed a huge improvement, not only it allows me to better think of myslef but also it saves me from doing things i don’t want to, say If I never wanted to ask out a girl and I do it because I feel more good, that will always be bad decision (everybody knows that) that’s what I feel is a problem, the solution to that is simple for me, create boundaries but expand them constanly, and then I should carefully choose the next things i want to add to myself.</p>
                  <p>lastly, before I start studying back now, I wanted to tell ya something, I had a on call interview (Technical) today for a internship position in a comapany at Hyd, it was afternon I was making some project from youtube, I picked the call and I agreed to answer his questions, he asked me about some projects and the skills I wrote in my CV, he asked me how to delete a directory in linux, WTF! I forgot it! The one good thing I did for years and I forgot, neither did I wanted to make a google search sabotaging my reputation nor stay quite, I tried a few guess like “cls”, “-r” luckily the late was the answer I checked it just now. he asked me about my experience in “CNN” and I blanked out this time, with nothing to say I just told I have a little experience but I’m not confident here, I didn’t answer a simple python question, about “mutable/immutable” data types I didn’t do good here lastly few things about my experience with Raspberry pico, i handled this one well and then finally I got to explain about the wrong answer, I said I follow a “learn and build approach” building things as I learn from docs/tutorials not simply mugging like I used to do before, he told me finally someone will get in touch in a few days, I don’t know if they will.. but it’s for us to see.</p>
                  <p>p.s. If you see any typo errors, this is the result of tradeoff between 75wpm or correct grammar insitu.</p>

                  <p>What did your ideal future self look like? Mine was a cooler version of Shubham — yeah, sometimes all I wanted was to be a more “cooler” version of myself. Thankfully, I didn’t try smoking, but it was a significant part of what I thought a happier future me would be like. For me, being cool meant knowing everything happening in the world of the internet, computers, science, and sci-fi. It played a major role in how I spent my time in school. Although I was a mildly naughty kid, in contrary I was, a shy one too. I remember crying in my science class over a petty argument with my friend. I even told my teacher, but she didn’t do anything, and I could hear my echo of crying at that time. Well, if someone from school is reading this, you might remember me as that quirky/anti-normal kid trying to do random weird stuff he saw on the internet. Although I wasn’t the best in studies, the conventional system of making notebooks and files seemed upsetting and boring to me. But I liked making PPTs because, for that, I was given some free money to go to the cybercafe and spend time on the computer. I never really had access to the internet until the ninth class — it was mostly accessible through smartphones or using postpaid dongles for computers, of which I had neither. But when I got my first computer at about 12 years of age, it was initially about running different software, going to local stores for installing games/software on the system. I became fond of some first-person games like Vice City, Condition Zero, Call of Duty, Halo, PvZ, Need for Speed, etc. It didn’t had speakers so had to use the inbuilt less louder ones, Then slowly, I shifted to the building side of it, like removing the hard disk while the computer is on or removing the side of the CPU to see internals, disconnecting various ribbon cables, and trying to make some sense out of my work. Learning some tricks and tips that I thought were cool to learn and show other people, like remembering the different hex values of colors to point out people in class. It was all fun. As time passed, I realized that these little things that I love really very much were the things keeping me stable and happy, even though I was not a big shot in studies. I stayed happy, or as they say, “fulfilled.” My confidence was built on it; I felt more confident the more I knew stuff. It helped me keep my head high in school life, make friends, and approach other people. These little things that I did in the past had an everlasting effect on my mind, which is how I think every day. It is what I always wanted to become. While I looked for passion every day in life when everyone told me to search for it, it was actually in my conversations (even the sad/dull ones), the things I talked about the most, the things that excited me the most, and I, being a fool, searched for it like it was an object.</p>
                  <p>P.S. As my exams are approaching an end now, it’s a new start for me, and I want to begin a new chapter, this time more focused and more specific, without a burning heart but a mind eager to see more of life in this time — a “me” time I wanted and to never look back at things again, to learn like a child again, this time in an unknown city in south india.</p>

                  <p>My exams will be starting soon again so I better get preparing for that now, I’ve did some portion actually and hoping to cover a big chunk which is still left, So it’ll be a short marathon from now, won’t consider it as a sprint, exams as usual have always been a marathon, it’s has became a common thing, my mind always delves into thinking about what I’ll be doing after exams, which has became disastrous at times. now I need to muffle that part for some time, while I do the task at hand, Applying a BFS approach now for my studies. I’ve also got to tackle some anxiety along, which is important to stay away from at this time.</p>
                  <p>I’ve wondered what would be the test results of today so I again took some long exposure shots, this time manually adjusting the parameters so I can gain more clearer shots, you can obviously see them here I’ve just uploaded today’s shots now, while observing this I saw a intersting phenomenon which usually made my shot a bit whitewashed but the reason was citylights! Now I know why can’t I see most of the stars these days and thus the need for long exposure even for closer stars. in the lower right corner of the picture you can see a bit washed out area (in hyperbolic shape) which was indeed coming from the streetlights, or from homes etc. while the nature is aesthetic in it’s own, seeing it from that perspective lowers the beauty sometimes and eventually leading it to fade in the eyes of beholder, that’s why I wish to keep this results to a few peopple only, to accept things the way they look sometimes is the best css you can apply to it, even though these aren’t the best looking pictures in the world, I like the feeling of staring and zooming at them, boy If had a large telescope I’d scout some exoplanets, the pleasure of naming them must be overflowing I think, until another species argues, but it’s fun anyways :) so I must do some work now, the night is long and I am anything but resting, through nights and days I shall pass, let the stars be my guide and sun be my lamp I shall walk through the deserts & grassy plains of life to see that horizon I was living for, until then I should keep up :)</p>

                  <div class="post-quote">The Instagram Propogation</div>
                  <p>“It’s different.”, Just two days ago, on New Year’s Eve, I spontaneously reactivated my Instagram and then thought, “Why not clear my head now?” I went live and announced to everyone that I will be building something I’ve long desired to create. Not only that, but I cleared my mind of everything I held within it. I’m uncertain of the effect it will have, but it matters to me. It was a bold move for someone like me, who barely tries to keep up with trends and has never gone live before. I told everyone about what I’ll be doing, Most people might have expected a New Year’s Eve party or something which is quite unusual for a nerd like me, who rarely changes his hoodie (never did, just mentioning for context).</p>
                  <p>I’m eager to create something — a super techy product that’s niche yet immensely useful to a select group of people. Over the next six months, this is my primary goal. I want to build something like a linchpin, an indispensable creation or something like “tinyurl” which is a simple yet cool thing to build. I have some small-scale ideas. What can I say, I’ve spent quite a alone time now, far away from most of the thing I used to be surrounded with also, I’ve realized that the notion of a “BIG LIFE” is an even bigger lie. Let me explain. While it might appeal to some, it’s certainly not my cup of tea. I cherish the smaller moments that, when compiled, form the essence of life as we understand it. I’ve understood that most of the things that appeal to me, such as a top-notch internship or even traveling with companions, can’t resolve my life’s complexities and dilemmas. It simply can’t. What they can do, however, is alter my environment, maintain clarity in thinking, or give me time & space to care about myself. Instead of fixating on the flashy things that grab my attention, I’ve often diverted my focus there, believing that a superior internship could solve my life. Yet, the truth remains — the constant in both the “before” and “after” phases is me.</p>
                  <p>While I live many lives at once, I seem to forget mine, bound by expectations, aspirations, and time. well, I don’t want to make Barnum statements, but I also don’t want to live others’ lives. Yes, I have been doing so until now, attempting to save relationships with holes that can’t be fixed today, dragging down with me my time, peace, and, importantly, my happiness.                  </p>
                  <p>Just moments ago, while heading to my terrace, I spotted some stars, or better yet, CONSTELLATIONS. I took some long exposure shots to capture the shining stars better. Quickly, I got on my computer and ran a check for the constellation names — indeed, there were more than one. This is what I found.. I am writing this blog since a prolonged time, I’ll try to stick to writing back again now besides all the rollercoaster ride of my life..</p>

                  <div class="post-quote">Dispersion Depression</div>
                  <p>“To every heaven and hell that reside within me, I’m deeply aware.”</p>
                  <p>In the midst of these Dark days, I aim to live a perspective that celebrates life’s myriad blessings and holds hope in every corner. Are our bright moments the sole memories that define us? There was a time when I feared they might wield that power, but no more. This phase of seeking solace in solitude has become somewhat addictive, a sanctuary from the pain. Yet, within this seclusion, I find comfort in the simple routines of daily life — pedaling to college, relishing breakfast at fixed hours. These commonplace yet soothing rituals served as the focal point in my fragmented world.</p>
                  <p>Sadly, nothing seems to stir my interest anymore. it has became boring to be not excited by the bits and bytes of the internet flowing through my network but something in the real world. which is the source of all the life that I have— the very essence of life. My future remains blurred, will I continue in circular motions or leap beyond the threshold I’ve always envisioned? The answer, I couldn’t know.</p>
                  <p>Depression, has firmly seeped itself in my life. It began several months ago, a bad semester result that disrupted my reality beyond my tunnel vision. The corridors of my college, once vibrant, now carry an cold air of desolation. Those familiar paths where friendships blossomed, where a mere nod brought smiles, now lie empty and dead. The classrooms, once the home to my imagination, now feel barren. a space where sharing vulnerabilities became a rarity, the pain intensifying when unspoken. Thus, solitude seems the only path to avoid distributing this pain to others. Whenever I revisit these spaces, my thoughts implode themselves, further fracturing my already broken heart. making the winds even colder, a professor’s bad criticism, which I ignored initially, gradually seeped into my subconscious, irreversibly altering my perception. Though he made attempts at fixing later, though the damage had been done, irreparable in my troubled state.</p>

                  <div class="post-quote">Internal Combustion</div>
                  <p>Is it even worth it? is it? the inner fight, the buried anger, the silence, the ability to hold your emotions back, the inability to cry, the long pause of silence between words, this so called wisdom that you have, to live for the things you never wanted, to sleep with a heavy chest, is this you ever wanted, is this why you slept at the terrace, staring at night skies and making imaginary constellations, is this what you dreamt for your whole childhood, is this why you started dreaming in the first place, why’d you wanna forget this life, this love, this curosity you had, for something that never belonged to you, Is it really you shubham, I’m talking to?</p>
                  <p>Am I diving into delusion? Not quite yet. I find myself ensnared within a timeline that was never tailored for me, or so I would assert. As a teenager, I may have appeared sloppy, not particularly active physically, yet my mind had already constructed an expansive world within — a world of perfection to me. Undoubtedly, delving deeper into technology was profoundly captivating, but there existed things beyond that. It was an burning sensation to converse with strangers traversing the streets, simply uncovering the narratives of others. This occupied a significant portion of my thoughts concerning my future, once I started living independently. but somehow due to some circumstances this interest of mine weathered away still somehow fossiled inside, probably because of how other people taught me to become a self-sustaining guy, which is indeed opposite of my true nature, which I got to realise real fast. also I’ve seen older people trying to find a meaning out of life (through pilgrimage etc.) I always wanted to make that effort early in my life while simultaneously focusing on my work, cause I didn’t wanted to get old and yet stand back at square one. In this restless life there are only limited balancing points in my life, some of which are the people close to me, this limited nature of life, this very situations I am in, makes me wonder more about the future, and is the cause of my sleepless nights.</p>
                  <p>Yet, during this summer while alone, I revisited this cherished childhood aspiration of mine. It was then that calculated the essence of my true desires — I yearned for a life without confines, an existence beyond the fetters of experiences, past, or future. I sought to inhabit the infinitude available to me within this ceaseless “life,” similar to an endless Pink Floyd riff. A life full of experiences (cause i can’t carry anything on my deathbed), escaping the confines of shadows and beyond myself— a life that I had always dreamt for. will I ever get that, what I’m always talking of? I don’t know.</p>

                  <p>“The convergence of two seemingly separate entities blending into a singular entity, yet they remain seprated” it is a curious aspect of my life. It’s similar to the interplay of yin and yang, where opposing forces coexist within a single existence. This duality, this paradox, passes through my experiences. Picture a coin with two distinct sides — yet it’s undeniably one coin. Similarly, in my life, there are contrasting elements that run in parallel. It’s the complexity of existence encapsulated within this paradox. At times, I’ve witnessed the fusion of both lightness and darkness, happiness and numbness existing simultaneously within me, a contradictory yet undeniable truth. I find myself alternating between being the composed, well-organized individual and the fragmented, vulnerable soul. Is this a trick of my fleeting memory or an inherent characteristic of life that I’ve sought since childhood? Nevertheless, I yearn for the simplicity reminiscent of those earlier days. This intricacy is reminiscent of my life’s “Perplexahedron,” a term inspired by the cubic planet concealing the fourth map of infinity. Much like solving its puzzle, life unfolds when approached with a keen eye for detail and depth of perception.</p>
                  <p>Recently, I’ve coined another term — the “Uniform Paradox.” It resonates deeply with my experiences. Having worn a school uniform for an extended period, I now find myself perplexed by the choices when selecting attire. What seems effortlessly simple for some becomes a bewildering array of combinations and colors for me. In an attempt to resolve this complexity, I associate outfits with my identity. For instance, I spent an entire winter exclusively wearing a black hoodie, even though I had other options. It became a symbol, linked to a fictional character, “Eliott” or Mr. Robot (A rogue hacker attempting to wash down the rich), representing a facet of my persona. I did good with it, even though I’m not a hacker myself, but I liked being called mr. robot, reminds me of Rami Malek, Next time I’ll pick something that reminds of Brian Cox :)                  </p>

                  <p>For a long time, I’ve wanted to watch “Notting Hill” and finally doing so struck a chord with me in precisely the way I had hoped. Its simplicity had a profound impact on how I perceive certain aspects of life. Interestingly, I find myself a personal connection to it, something intangible that perhaps you and I couldn’t discern with our naked eyes but is evident to me through the chemical reactions in my brain. Usually, I’m not one to delve into discussions about movies, but this particular film has managed to establish a link with me through a yet-to-be-explored channel. well not to give you any spoilers but the point of notting hill for me, lies in the place itself, while notting hill might seem a pleasing architectural to the eyes of many, it is one of the places that you’d find me in the future.</p>
                  <p>I’ve stopped drinking tea since a month almost, even though it used to be a significant part of my routine. It’s a small change, yet a notable one for me. I used to be a drink it a lot — having it right out of bed and then a few more times during college — but I never quite felt right about it. so having taken this step, it is quite a change, I feel more refreshed now without anything to have, it has affected my skin positively too, never saw that coming, huh. apart from that, I can’t stop to wonder about the possiblites of my life, well these days I like to hide from the big events in my life, not doing anything much, not challenging my faith too much, scrapping the pieces of happiness from the little moments in my life, but is this what I always lived for? the answer to this can’t be put into words easily but you can see I’m trying to, I definetely never wanted to be a rebel, instead of the times I was desperately eager to hack into my school’s computer systems and give myself some grades of glory, and that never happened :)</p>

                  <p>Do you know Lucky Ali? Of course, you do! :) How about something to make you feel nostalgic? Today, as I was clearing some old stuff from my father’s shop — a Diwali tradition in India, involving cleaning out old items from houses and shops — I stumbled upon something that instantly caught my eye. In a millisecond, the image of pyramids and seashells wired in my brain pointed towards “Sunoh,” the album by Lucky Ali. It contained all the best songs that come to mind when you think of Lucky Ali. There it was — an old cassette covered in fine dust amidst a pile of other famous artists’ cassettes.</p>
                  <p>While Lucky Ali resides in our hearts, his musical masterpiece couldn’t stay confined to that dusty bag any longer. So, I picked it up along with a bunch of other cassettes, cleaned them, and safely stored them in a box. Rediscovering this artistic gem brings great joy. However, it also prompts reflection on how a lifetime of hard work, passion, joy, and patience can go unnoticed by many. I realize it’s not mathematically possible for everyone in the world to know about every individual, especially as we move towards a multiplanetary existence.</p>
                  <p>Isn’t it discomforting to think that people may not know who I am and whether or not I ever walked on the grassy plains of this planet? (My fossils won’t be as big and distinctive as a smug T-rex) regardless of how long or short I live. But you know what? I remember a poem from my English class in school — though the details escape me. It conveyed that statues weather with the wind, empires disappear with the test of time, and the rulers eventually die. Yet, poetry/art remains resilient, passed from generation to generation. I believe that’s what Lucky Ali did, that’s what artists do. They create something indestructible that can never vanish with time.</p>
                  <p>Atlast I can say, Even if my work or life goes unnoticed by some, it will at least never die.</p>

    <p>I apologise if my words don’t make any sense to you, it’s me, complicated. How to fix life? It was a question consistent through my search history some years ago. I really wondered about it, is there a quick easy answer to that? I was not patient enough to find these answers. But there lies something deeper than finding those answers, there’s this deep desire in me, to do something and dive in it headfirst, get so deep inside that even sunlight can’t be traced there. And there lies my weakness to run after a single thing such passionately that I couldn’t trace my life back, which hurts after all.</p>

    <p>Lying in shallow waters is something I can’t do anymore, to avoid thinking about life, to avoid challenges, to be something you aren’t, to be an observer to your own life, let people drive your life’s wagon, romanticise the pain listening to that music, becoming someone I don’t want, I can’t live with. Like Elliott said, “I can be another fool, or an exception to the rule.” The choice was mine to make. I wondered if there exists an algorithm for fixing everything, with O(1) time complexity. It turns out I was insane to find that thing. I feel life is not a mere collection of events, it is the events occurring in the sequence which makes the life as we live it, much smaller than I can observe.</p>

    <p>I know even if my writings are unknown to most, writing taught me to wait for better things in life, and to feel better for the ones you have today. All my writings have taught me more about myself each time, it’s like reading a book about yourself, but someone else wrote it. I write my heart out, so I naturally feel good about what I write. I feel like I was driven by emotions at some point of time in my life, all my decisions etc. were somehow connected to what I felt and another time I took radical decisions, ignoring what my heart wanted, I’ll call them “just do it” days. I don’t like the extreme points very much in life, one that feels my complete life is a dream and another feels my complete life is incomplete code. To say, neither of them are enjoyable, the perfect fun lies in the secret mix of both these, it’s a sweet spot and I gotta find it. Of all the things I like in my life I enjoy brotherhood very much, I can say that clearly now (as I’ve experienced it) it’s the best environment I thrive in. To be surrounded by people of my age/interests, maybe it’s a little to ask but it’s a paradise for people like me to live in.</p>
