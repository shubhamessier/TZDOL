                <p>Woah, what a month this has been I'll try my personal best to encapsulate it. I still remember the first day of this month, when I took a break from the office to meet someone – it was kind of daring of me to do so I had to make some professional lie to make everyone believe it. It turned out to be a good memory of mine, I enjoyed that evening, eating the spaghetti I didn't like very much.</p>
                <p>All my life, I've been riding sinking boats, and I didn't want to ride any more. Even when things went south, I still wanted to keep up with it, trying to save something that wasn't going to stay despite my best efforts. But how would I know? I didn't even have the chance to give my best efforts. I don't know why, but nobody really wants to enjoy life for what it is, for what and how beautiful it can be. It makes sense when you realize that there exist ways to dilute your pain, to dilute your experience. However, the dilution of pain comes at a bigger cost of life, and in the end, it's a tradeoff.</p>
                <p>I also had to leave the sinking boats, as the wise ones say, you have to leave from somewhere to get somewhere. The phrase "leaving isn't easy, so is moving on" resonates with me. For some, it might be, but for me, it is painful. It leaves me with a migraine and chaos all together. I begin to love chaos in my life, or I can say that disorder is my order. My head felt like an exploding time bomb, ready to go off any second… but I managed through it. I managed through the pain, and in the end, it left me wanting to love myself, or support myself in the moments I never did. For all the stupid rules I set for myself, the lack of understanding about my own self is the thing that gets me into troubles and uninvited pain. I accept it I open my arms for all the pain that comes. I will go through it I'll rather be in pain than having my life fucked every day for some sad reason.</p>
                <p>But at this point in my life, I want more challenges, more sleepless nights. I want to come out of it strong and better than ever, not the same Shubham again. I didn't want the constant hurting to continue. I refuse to be someone else's second option for my life.</p>
                <p>If you didn't understand any of this, maybe you shouldn't try to. There's a lot more to my life than this, than any of this. After all this happened, I had an intense week of working on the prototype I've been building. I focused every second of my life on it, pulling late-nighters all weekend. I remember one fine evening of constant hacking and programming I chugged three cups of dark coffee. I was like a workhorse, running every single brain cell to achieve the things at hand. I programmed the entire download page at night and also the entire backend for the prototype alone. I finally did it, thousands of compilation errors and issues later. I finally built something worth showing to people. I wasn't completely alone in all this my colleagues helped me through this process. And in doing so, I stayed in the present. I could feel every click of the mouse, every keystroke on the keyboard — nothing else in life, no pain, no regrets. It was a zen thing for me. That was a really memorable week for my life. I did all this with a ticking time bomb strapped to my head. I worked past deadlines, past regularity, and past comfort. I was in a continuum, unbothered and fast.</p>

                   <p>I couldn't really say much, but the events of life become recurring sometimes, different roads, but same crossroads. I had an office party, a celebration, which became a fun yet memorable experience of my life. I've been living in Jaipur for quite some time now. I've gone to Badi Chaupar thrice, and it holds a lot of bittersweet memories for me. I haven't had time to visit other places much. Anyway, we planned for an evening above the ground, at Jaipur's famous fort, to really end the day with a royal touch. While my colleagues were busy taking pictures, I sat down quietly on a wall fence, tripping over city lights as they shone like distant stars in the twilight of the never-tiring city life. It was a moment of reflection for all the things I've been doing since I came here, and of how I haven't changed at all.</p>
                   <p>I saw someone taking pictures of the city beside me. I saw her taking those shots, and I was in her way, so I gave her some space. Then I controlled myself, but I told her, "You can lower the exposure, the pictures will be even better." She said, I am also learning these days to click these shots", I did some tweaks on her phone, and she liked it. I couldn't resist myself, so I asked her to take pictures of herself. I clicked a few, and she liked them apparently. With just fine adjustments, those portraits looked beautiful. I couldn't believe myself, so I asked a little about her. She told me about the places she has been to and her experience of the city.</p>
                   <p>It was time to go, my colleagues ordered something, so I had to go. But before going, I mumbled that, "I might not like to have your contact, there's a beauty to missing someone." I asked her name before going. It was moments after going that I realized what I couldn't explain to her. I asked my colleague what to do now, and she told me to "run back". And yeah, that's what I did next, I ran back to the same place and said, "Hey, Sandhya, I've figured out the equation of what I wanted to say. I told her about my bad experiences of meeting a person and having to stay in touch with messages back and forth, keeping the relation alive. There's a beauty to leaving things at open ends after all, we all want someone to miss. She really understood and said, "You came back now take some more pictures." I happily did.</p>
                   <p>Then I had to leave I shook hands and left, and that was the evening I was yearning for a long time, something to make me feel alive and back human. I couldn't calculate if I am ever going to meet her I don't really feel sad. I feel some good in me and more contentment of what this day has been. Even if I don't get to meet Sandhya again, but one thing I know for sure  how boring my life feels. I know contentment is found in the fort on the hill. And the evening after that? That's a story for another time.</p>
